      Mobile World Congress will be missing its usual Samsung flagship star in Barcelona next month, but there’s another Korean company ready to fill the void. LG has set a February 26th date for the unveiling of the G6, its next flagship Android phone, and The Verge has obtained the first image of the upcoming phone.As previously revealed by LG Display and confirmed by The Verge, the G6 will feature a large 5.7-inch display with an unusual aspect ratio of 2:1 and an emphasis on minimal bezels. The new phone’s screen-to-bezel ratio is greater than 90 percent, and though its bottom isn’t shown in the image, it’s only slightly taller than the top bezel (below). Xiaomi’s Mi Mix is the closest competitor to LG’s new handset in this quest to make an all-screen phone, though there’s also a tantalizing leak of a purported Samsung Galaxy S8 screen cover that makes it seem like Samsung’s going down a similar path as well. Like the Mi Mix and the rumored S8, the G6 has curved display corners.            The headphone jack lives on!Having abandoned the modular design of last year’s G5, LG looks set to prioritize design this year, with our source indicating that the G6 will be made entirely out of glass and metal — a final and conclusive departure from the unpleasant plastic that characterized the company’s previous flagship devices. The G6 will have a headphone jack and is expected to be waterproof as well. Its battery, however, will no longer be replaceable.Not everything from the G5 has been discarded in LG’s 2017 update. The rear design of the phone, including the dual-camera system and center-mounted fingerprint sensor, is expected to make a return in the G6.LG is in a precarious position in the smartphone market today, having failed to turn a meaningful profit from its mobile business for years and suffering the setback of last year’s ill-fated modular experiment. The G6 is thus an even more critical device than the usual, desperate-for-differentiation Android smartphone.                LG G6 (click to enlarge)  Stay tuned to our Mobile World Congress coverage to find out the full details on the LG G6 and all the other Android flagships launching in Barcelona this February.
      You might have missed it a couple weeks ago, but Sonos has a new CEO: Patrick Spence. In what, by The New York Times account, was a planned and straightforward transfer, Sonos founder John MacFarlane stepped aside to hand the reins to Spence, who came to Sonos four years ago, after a VP stint at BlackBerry. And the new CEO has a new mission: keep the independent company alive and kicking as it faces a wave of disruption coming directly from the biggest technology companies on the planet.Sonos makes home speakers — precisely the space that’s getting upended by Amazon’s Echo and (to a lesser extent so far) Google Home. It’s perhaps not entirely fair to say Sonos was blindsided by the rise of digital assistants in the home but it is entirely fair to say that the company hasn’t reacted quickly enough to their sudden importance.We’ve obtained a slightly redacted copy of the memo that Spence sent to his company immediately after taking over, and it reveals some of what Sonos is going to do to face those new challenges. Namely: it’s going to try to get everybody to play nice with Sonos. “What got us here won’t alone get us through the next phase.”“We know that life at home requires the support of a variety of services,” Spence writes. And rather than partner with a single company, he says Sonos will work with everybody just like it did with music streaming apps: “We are going to do the same with voice services, bringing all the services that matter to every home.”Sonos is already planning on some integration with Amazon Alexa, but it seems like other services are going to follow — assuming Sonos can somehow remain independent and somehow convince all of these potential partners to share space on its speakers. Spence references this new balance and says Sonos will enter “the big leagues – partnering and competing with global leaders like Amazon, Google and (likely) Apple.”There’s more to Spence’s memo, reproduced below, including a need to have “bias to action” when it comes to dealing with those issues and “more product innovation.” It paints a picture of a CEO that knows exactly what his company needs to do in order to remain both independent and profitable — the trick now is that Spence and Sonos need to get to it, and fast.Team, I am humbled and honored by the opportunity to serve as your CEO. I joined Sonos four and half years ago for two reasons: First, I was a passionate Sonos customer – it changed the way my family and I enjoy music around our home. It was awesome to see my friends sharing their favorite musical memories around our dining room table and to see my two kids dancing their hearts out in the kitchen. Our company matters because music matters, and bringing that into more homes matters more than ever. The second reason I joined was because of the people. The first person I met was John, and he was even more wonderful than the product. And then I got to meet the talented team and was blown away. Every day I leave work inspired by the passion and ideas I see from all of you. My passion for why we're here, for what we build, and my love for all of you has only grown over that time. For these reasons, taking on the CEO role is incredibly exciting, and I’m all in. I’d like thank John for his leadership in bringing Sonos from an idea to a company of more than 1,300 people that has filled millions of homes with music. He’s done it by leading with clear mission and strong set of values. He has taught us what is possible when all of us show up every day ready to pursue our mission and carry out those values. John is a special entrepreneur, and one of the most selfless and high integrity people I know. We will build on this great foundation and relentlessly pursue the mission he set the company on fifteen years ago. With the full arrival of streaming, the advent of voice, and the promise of the connected home, we are at a pivotal and defining moment – this is our time. The next few years will define our future as we step into the big leagues – partnering and competing with global leaders like Amazon, Google and (likely) Apple. It requires new thinking and a different pace than we had in our first fifteen years. We know that life at home requires the support of a variety of services since each family member has their own preferences. We have already proven the ability to do this in an elegant and reliable way with music services. We are going to do the same with voice services, bringing all the services that matter to every home. This, combined with our strength and breadth in music streaming services, our commitment to building a software platform that partners can easily build on, our variety of awesome products that fit every room (vs. a one-size-fits-all approach), and sound quality that makes music come alive unlike anyone else, sets us up for a strong future. We must challenge ourselves to stay ahead of the curve. Being great doesn’t always require being first, but when it comes to the home music experience, we must be the pioneer. More companies are jumping into our space because they see the big opportunity ahead. What got us here won’t alone get us through the next phase. Given this, there are two important areas we need to evolve: First, we must have a bias towards action. You are all talented and bring diverse perspectives. You have ideas. Please share them freely – especially before they’re “perfect.” Take a risk and share them with others. Listen to the new ideas of your colleagues with the goal of learning about what could be, and help them make them better. Apply yourself to putting ideas into action and being nimble enough to adjust along the way. The pace in which we do this must be faster than the rate of change in the world, and the world is getting a lot faster. Second, we must innovate boldly. When Sonos began, it was all about product innovation– and while we need more product innovation and pace than ever, we also need to expand our innovative thinking to the way we market to customers, the way we sell to customers, and the way we service customers. We need to be bold about where we believe the world should go, and then we need to lead it there. I’m fired up to go after the opportunity in front of us, and bring the joy of Sonos to millions of new homes. I look forward to doing it together with all of you. Best, Patrick    
      Ding Lei, a top executive at Chinese tech giant LeEco and “global CEO” of Faraday Future, has stepped down from overseeing Faraday Future, sources tell The Verge. Faraday Future never had an official CEO — the company has gone almost two years without naming one — but sources tell The Verge that Ding helped run things from his perch at LeEco, a major investor in FF. He joined LeEco in 2015 as chairman of LeSupercar and was seen as the company’s second most prominent spokesperson after founder Jia Yueting. He is also the former vice president at the Shanghai Automotive Industry corporation. A spokesperson for LeEco said that Ding is still employed at the Chinese company with the title co-founder and global vice chairman of SEE Plan. She referred all questions about his oversight of Faraday Future to that company’s press contact, which has yet to respond to a request for comment. We will update this piece when we hear back from FF.                 Ding Lei, second from the left, at the groundbreaking of FF’s factory in North Las Vegas.  Ding spearheaded LeEco’s self-driving electric car project, the LeSee, which was unveiled at the company’s everything-but-the-kitchen-sink event in California last October. According to sources, Ding was given the title of “acting global CEO” of Faraday Future by LeEco’s founder and chairman Jia Yueting until a permanent replacement could be found. Ding was also present at the April groundbreaking of FF’s $1 billion factory in North Las Vegas, which has since stalled due to a financial shortfall.  He also took the stage at the unveiling of FF’s Batmobile-style concept race car, the FFZERO1, at last year’s CES. Rumors are swirling that Ding could join China’s NextEV, which launched its own ultra-fast electric car last November, but his potential role there remains unclear. Ding was never officially on FF’s leadership team, but his departure does mark the latest in a string of high-level resignations at the electric carmaker. Last week, Marco Mattiacci, chief brand and commercial officer, and Joerg Sommer, vice president for product marketing and growth, both left the company.  Next week, FF is expected to unveil its first production model at CES. The company has been teasing the reveal for months, posting teaser images and short videos of its camouflaged vehicle going head-to-head on a racetrack against a Bentley, a Ferrari, and a Tesla Model X. Meanwhile, the startup has been drowning in a deluge of bad press. The Verge published a behind the scenes report of FF during a time of both high expectations and worrisome financial news for the electric carmaker. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees showed the company’s financial situation to be dire, while mounting debts, unpaid bills, supplier lawsuits, and financial mismanagement have all served to chip away at the company’s foundation.Update Dec. 29th, 12:10PM ET:  We had previously reported that Ding had left LeEco and Faraday Future. This piece has been updated to reflect LeEco’s comments. 
      Faraday Future, the much-hyped electric carmaker that lately has descended into turmoil, just lost two of its top executives, two sources confirmed to The Verge. Marco Mattiacci, chief brand and commercial officer, and Joerg Sommer, vice president for product marketing and growth, have left the company, the sources said. Both have been removed from FF’s website, two blank spaces where their profiles once stood. The Verge has reached out to an FF spokesperson for comment, and we’ll update this post if we hear back. Before joining FF, Mattiacci was president and CEO of Ferrari North America and Ferrari Asia Pacific, as well as managing director and team principal of Scuderia Ferrari Formula 1 racing team. He was a big get for FF when he joined just seven months ago. Former employees characterized Mattiacci as someone at the company attempting to right the ship and fix many of FF’s financial mistakes. Sommer, a former Volkswagen executive, was at FF for even shorter stretch, having just come on board just three months ago. Prior to his work at VW, Sommer held executive roles at several European carmakers, including Daimler, Opel, and Renault. One source said the resignations of Mattiacci and Sommer could be seen as a round of belt-tightening by FF prior to the debut of its first production model at CES in two weeks. Both executives were highly compensated, and their departure could free up needed funds for the company. Yesterday, The Verge published a behind the scenes report of FF during a time of both high expectations and worrisome financial news for the electric carmaker. But interviews with a half-dozen former employees showed the company’s financial situation to be dire, while mounting debts, unpaid bills, supplier lawsuits, and financial mismanagement have all served to chip away at Faraday Future’s foundation.
      Google will be launching two new flagship smartwatches in the first quarter of next year, according to Jeff Chang, product manager of Android Wear at Google. In an exclusive interview with The Verge, Chang said that the new watches will be the flagship Android Wear 2.0 devices and will be the first ones to launch with the new platform.The new smartwatches had been rumored before, but Google confirmed the upcoming launch today as part of a larger effort to convince consumers that wearables — smartwatches specifically — are still in demand.The new models will not have Google or Pixel branding, but will be branded by the company that is manufacturing them. Chang says that Google collaborated with the manufacturer — which he wouldn’t name, but said has produced Android Wear devices in the past — on the hardware design and software integration for the watches. He likened the partnership to Google’s Nexus smartphone program in terms of collaboration and goals.Following the launch of the new devices, existing Android Wear watches will get the update to Android Wear 2.0. The new platform brings a number of new features, including standalone apps that don’t require a phone to work, support for Android Pay, and support for Google’s voice-controlled Assistant, which has already launched on the Pixel smartphones and Home speaker. Not every existing Android Wear watch will be updated, but Google says most of the recent models will be. Certain features, such as Android Pay, require specific hardware, so not all models will support them. (Chang noted that the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition has NFC support and the new watches coming next year will have it, as well, but it is not a requirement for Android Wear partners at this time.) Google will release the fifth and final developer preview of Android Wear 2.0 in January, and it is expected to include support for both Google Assistant and Android Pay (on supported devices) in it. It will also work with iOS devices, and Chang confirmed that while there will be differences between Wear 2.0 on Android and iOS, Android Pay will work on both platforms.In addition, Chang says that after Google’s flagship watches launch, other partners will release new devices with Android Wear 2.0 throughout 2017. Partner announcements on new devices are expected at both CES in a couple of weeks and the Baselworld trade show later in 2017. The company says it’s committed to supporting and promoting these launches in order to help build awareness in a consumer climate that is becoming increasingly adverse to smartwatches and wearables in general.Though the smartwatch market is still nascent compared to smartphones, it appears that Apple is already starting to run away with it, and its only competition so far has been from Samsung, which doesn’t use Google’s platform on its devices. Fitbit is the leader in fitness trackers, but its recent purchase of Pebble indicates that it will be looking to move into the smartwatch market, as well. None of that bodes well for Google, which has already spent two and a half years trying to make Android Wear a success, with less than stellar results.Chang says that Google’s strategy of working with many partners on Android Wear devices is advantageous. “We've enabled a lot of diversity with our hardware partners to target different types of consumers and preferences,” he says, before noting that Google is “quite optimistic” about the prospects of smartwatches. “This is a marathon, not a sprint. This category of product is here with us to stay.”Lauren Goode contributed to this report.Update, 2:05PM ET, December 22nd, 2016: Added further clarification that the new devices will not be branded by Google.
      We’ve all been there: you land at an airport, book an Uber to your hotel, only to find 20 identical black Honda CR-Vs waiting when you get outside. Which one is yours? Or it’s late, you’re leaving the club with a buzz, and inadvertently leap into back of the wrong Toyota Camry. Sure, you could check for the right license plate number, but who has time for that nonsense? What you really need is a device you control to guide you into the right backseat. Meet Beacon, Uber’s first foray into hardware.             The Beacon is essentially a glowing, plastic Uber logo that drivers can affix to the inside of their windshields. It’s Bluetooth-enabled, so after a driver accepts your ride request, a prompt will appear in your app that asks you to choose a specific color. If you choose green, the driver’s Beacon will glow green. Choose magenta, it will glow magenta. Either way, when he arrives at your destination, you’ll know it, no guesswork needed. “You can match the license plate, you can match the make and model,” Nikhil Goel, product lead on the Beacon project, told me. “But this is kind of another tool we’re giving you to personalize your ride.”I got to play with a Beacon yesterday at Uber’s New York City headquarters. Goel showed me how moving the slider in the app to select the right color instantly corresponded to the color of the Beacon. The effect was very cool, but it remains to be seen how well the color projects in darkness and bad weather conditions.  Beacon is the offshoot of Spot, a product pilot launched by Uber in Seattle almost a year ago. In an effort to eliminate awkward vehicle mixups, Uber provided its Seattle drivers with long, thin LED lights to attach to the inside of their windshields. Riders could control the color of the device so they could better identify their drivers. Uber found that Spot reduced the need for riders and drivers to contact one another and lowered cancellation rates in tricky pickup locations. The positive feedback convinced Uber to take it to the next level. “Knowing that Spot was well-received in Seattle, we set out to design new and improved hardware,” said John Badalamenti, senior design lead at Uber. “We knew we had to design this to be seen at night, being very sensitive to the installation process, etc. Really the goal was to develop something that we could scale.”That means the Beacon had to be inexpensive enough to mass-produce that Uber could afford to distribute them to all 1.5 million drivers worldwide without breaking the bank. (Although, given Uber’s $68 billion valuation, it’s hard to see how that could happen.) But it also needed to look familiar, which was why Uber designed the Beacon to look like its new logo. “If you’re familiar with the environment in the car, it’s a very sensitive situation,” Badalamenti said. “This is an environment where subtle design detail gets lost and bold design really wins.”Uber considered every design detail. That included ensuring that the Beacon wasn’t flush with the windshield, but instead floated a few centimeters away from the glass so drivers could see the reflection of the color their rider picked. The Beacon’s color can also be customized to correspond with certain events, like Pride Week or a sports victory. The device is wireless, and can operate for up to 20 hours on one charge. To start out, Uber will be distributing its new Beacon gadgets to drivers in five cities: Miami, Nashville, Denver, Belfast, and Newcastle. Drivers will be invited to secret community meetings, where they will receive their Beacons at no cost, charging equipment included. The devices will be rolled out to more cities throughout 2017, with the goal of making them “ubiquitous” by the end of the year, Goel said.             The Beacon may look a little familiar to those who follow closely the ride-sharing industry. That’s because Lyft recently unveiled its own candy-colored device called the Amp. The LED device, which attaches magnetically to the dashboard, is designed to both prevent those awkward car mix-ups with passengers and replace the company’s iconic furry pink mustache logo. Unlike the Beacon, the Amp has two LED displays, one facing out and the other facing inside the car. Messages can be displayed on either screen, such as “Welcome [your name here].” Surprisingly, Uber decided to go with a device that infringes less on your privacy.  Both companies anticipate rolling out their devices in a limited number of cities before New Year’s Eve, when the confluence of ride-sharing and drunk passengers is at its peak. Given the number of devices ride-sharing drivers have attached to their dashboards these days, the idea of taking some of that screen-glow and projecting out into the real world seems like a fair deal. 
      Twitter is about to make a big change to the way that tweets work, The Verge can independently confirm. Beginning September 19th, the company will cut down on exactly which types of content count toward the platform's 140-character limit. Media attachments (images, GIFs, videos, polls, etc.) and quoted tweets will no longer reduce the count. The extra room for text will give users more flexibility in composing their messages.Twitter first announced plans to stop counting extras like photos, videos, and user polls toward the limit back in May, but gave no firm date on when the shift would occur. A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by The Verge. The date comes from two sources familiar with the company's business, but plans for the rollout could change.Another new adjustment to the character limit is that usernames will no longer count when they're at the beginning of replies, giving users additional room for discussion. It's unclear whether all of these changes will occur simultaneously certain content types may gradually stop counting against the character limit in stages. But the company will at least kick off the move next Monday."This is the most notable change we’ve made in recent times around conversation in particular, and around giving people the full expressiveness of the 140 characters," CEO Jack Dorsey&ampnbsptold The Verge in May. "I’m excited to see even more dialog because of this."The company has previously considered dramatically extending the maximum length of tweets. But in January,&ampnbspDorsey walked that back a bit and praised the 140 limit — originally implemented so that tweets could fit within SMS messages — as a "beautiful constraint" He vowed that Twitter would "never lose" the creativity, brevity, and speed necessitated by the character limit, even as it continues looking into new ways for users to express themselves more thoroughly beyond "tweetstorms" and screenshots of the iPhone's Notes app. This approach stays true to that concise feeling while adding more convenience at the same time. Starting next week, the character limit will center around the message itself — not the media attached to it.Update September 12th 6:00PM ET: The original story has been updated with additional sourcing and clarification. 
      For months, Uber has been fending off fraud allegations related to an investigation into one of its legal opponents, which the company&ampnbspcommissioned from a secretive CIA-linked research firm called Ergo. Documents related to the case also refer to other investigations Uber contracted with Ergo for, and so far, the details of those investigations have remained secret.Now, The Verge has found evidence of a separate Ergo project investigating union politics in Seattle, conducted shortly after a controversial ordinance in December granted the city's drivers the power to bargain collectively. Uber confirmed the project and characterized the effort as research into the city's political landscape, emphasizing that it was not targeted at any individuals or drivers. Investigating "recent developments in labor unionization in Seattle"In one email, Ergo reached out to a labor historian named Trevor Griffey, seeking insight into "the recent developments in labor unionization in Seattle" and offering to pay for consultation work on the topic. The email was sent in mid-January, roughly a month after the collective bargaining ordinance was passed. Griffey declined the offer and shared the email with The Verge.In the email, the sender identifies himself as an Ergo representative, but says his work is on behalf of a private, anonymous client and that the resulting study will not be released to the public. According to the message, the study would deal with "Seattle's political stakeholders and the dynamics of labor unions in the city." The final report was due to be submitted "relatively soon." Ergo did not respond to requests for comment.Uber has undertaken a number of initiatives to convince Seattle drivers not to support the newly empowered App Based Drivers Association. In January, Uber customer service representatives began contacting Seattle-based drivers with a new script, which began as a driver satisfaction survey but concluded with a strong anti-union message. "This is simply a case where collective bargaining and unionization do not fit the characteristics of the work," the script read, a turn one former employee characterized as "union-busting.""We don’t have anything to hide."While Uber took no public position while the Seattle ordinance was being debated, it lobbied heavily behind the scenes and released a number of studies favorable to Uber&ampnbspwhile the bill was being considered. Some Uber drivers were also deactivated by the service after participating in pro-union activities, which some characterized as an act of political harassment by the company.The US Chamber of Commerce has&ampnbspfiled a lawsuit against the city of Seattle to suspend the new rule, an effort that Uber has vigorously supported."I’m not surprised they’re investigating us but I don’t know what new information there is to be gained," said Dawn Gearheart, a Teamsters official who’s been providing organizational support for the new union. "We don’t have anything to hide."In New York, Uber continues to face fallout from the Ergo investigation into a class action plaintiff and his lawyer. On Monday, US District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled that Ergo had "engaged in fraudulent and arguably criminal conduct" while pursuing its investigation and barred its report from being used in court. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick agreed to pay Meyer and his legal team an undisclosed sum of money as recompense for the breach."It is a sad day," Rakoff wrote, "[when] a corporate defendant feels compelled to hire unlicensed private investigators to conduct secret personal background investigations of both the plaintiff and his counsel."In a deposition related to the case, an Uber executive testified that the company had hired Ergo for four separate investigations. No further details were made public, and the bulk of the deposition remains under seal. Uber has not disclosed any information regarding its other operations with the firm.
      Satya Nadella bounded into the conference room, eager to talk about intelligence. I was at  Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, WA, and the company’s CEO was touting the company's progress in building more intelligent apps and services. Each morning, he told me, he puts on a HoloLens, which enables him to look at a virtual, interactive calendar projected on a wall of his house. Nadella appeared giddy as he described it. The system was intelligent, productive, and futuristic: everything he hopes Microsoft will be under his leadership. No matter where we work in the future, Nadella says, Microsoft will have a place in it. The company’s "conversation as a platform" offering, which it unveiled in March, represents a bet that chat-based interfaces will overtake apps as our primary way of using the internet: for finding information, for shopping, and for accessing a range of services. And apps will become smarter thanks to "cognitive APIs," made available by Microsoft, that let them understand faces, emotions, and other information contained in photos and videos.Microsoft argues that it has the best "brain," built on nearly two decades of advancements in machine learning and natural language processing, for delivering a future powered by artificial intelligence. It has a head start in building bots that resonate with users emotionally, thanks to an early experiment in China. And among the giants, Microsoft was first to release a true platform for text-based chat interfaces — a point of pride at a company that was mostly sidelined during the rise of smartphones.     After losing on mobile, can Microsoft win the next battle?   In January, The Verge described the tech industry's search for the killer bot. In the months that followed, companies big and small have accelerated their development efforts. Facebook opened up a bot development platform of its own, running on its popular Messenger chat app. Google announced a new intelligent assistant running inside Allo, a forthcoming messenger app, and Home, its Amazon Echo competitor. Meanwhile the Echo, whose voice-based inputs have captivated developers, is reportedly in 3 million homes, and has added 1,200 "skills" through its API.Microsoft is proud of its work on AI, and eager to convey the sense that this time around, it's poised to win. In June, it invited me to its campus to interview some of Nadella's top lieutenants, who are building AI into every corner of the company's business. Over the next two days, Microsoft showed me a wide range of applications for its advancements in natural language processing and machine learning.The company, as ever, talks a big game. Microsoft's historical instincts about where technology is going have been spot-on. But the company has a record of dropping the ball when it comes to acting on that instinct. It saw the promise in smartphones and tablets, for example, long before its peers. But Apple and Google beat Microsoft anyway. The question looming over the company's efforts around AI is simple:Why should it it be different this time?  Microsoft has already had more success building bots than perhaps any other US company. But you probably aren’t aware of it, because its success started in China.In January 2016, one of Microsoft's artificial intelligence creations appeared on the Chinese morning news show Dragon TV when the newscaster cut away to its weather forecaster, Xiaoice. Pronounced "SHAO-ICE," it’s a bot whose name is Chinese for "little Bing." That's Bing as in Microsoft's perennial also-ran search engine. But this version of Bing is way more talkative.The camera cut to an animated circle hovering in front of a virtual podium. The face transformed into an image of a microphone, and in a soft female voice, Xiaoice shared her forecast, even answering a question from the anchor.   "We’ve found a bot that works in a new way that fulfills many of the promises of conversation."   If you want to know why Microsoft has become so bullish on bots, Xiaoice is a big part of the answer. "I’m not going to go so far as to say we’ve found the killer bot — but we’ve found a bot that works in a new way that fulfills many of the promises of conversation," says Derrick Connell, head of search engineering at Bing.Xiaoice, which Microsoft introduced on the Chinese messaging app WeChat in 2014, can answer simple questions, just like Microsoft's virtual assistant Cortana. Where Xiaoice excels, though, is in conversation. The bot is programmed to be sensitive to emotions, and to remember your previous chats. Going through a breakup? Xiaoice may check in to ask you how you're doing.After it was available for three days, Xiaoice had been added to 1.5 million conversations on the Chinese mega-messenger app WeChat. It was later made available on the Chinese micro-blogging service Weibo, where it became one of the most popular celebrity accounts to follow. Today the bot has been used by more than 40 million people, and the average conversation takes an impressive 26 turns between speaker and bot.For Connell, Xiaoice points the way toward the next generation of search. Web queries traditionally returned a page with 10 blue hyperlinked results the perfect conversational bot will simply return the correct answer.Of course, success in China may not translate to the United States. (Microsoft’s first English-language bot experiment, Tay, was a fiasco.) Two years after Xiaoice's debut, there's still no English-language equivalent, and none is imminent. But Microsoft executives say the infrastructure behind Xiaoice represents a significant opportunity for the company."We want it to be an ecosystem.""It's the modern era — you don't have to be an expert in speech and language understanding," Connell says. "Just use our tools. Go build your branded bot with our tools and put it on whatever canvas — it might be Slack, it might be Facebook Messenger. We hope it might be Skype or Windows. But you choose."And with fears mounting among developers that a war could emerge over bot standards, Microsoft has been uncharacteristically diplomatic. It organized a conference in San Francisco in June to promote cooperation among bot-makers. "We're really interested in it being interoperable — we want it to be an ecosystem," says Lili Cheng, a senior engineer at Microsoft who helped organize the two-day event. (It was called Botness.) "It's more like, what are the problems and challenges that we are finding that we can work on together?"But by taking the lead with events like Botness, Microsoft hopes to position itself at the center of the shift to bots. If the company succeeds, it will have a fresh start in the mobile era. Bots powered by the company's technology could show up inside each of the world's most popular messaging apps, giving Microsoft a lucrative foothold in the new world.              The strategyOf course, Microsoft isn't alone in trying to build the defining platform for the next generation of computing — if conversation even turns out to be that platform. Every major tech company and a host of startups are building AI divisions, often with impressive results. But here it's worth saying that comparing AI across companies is difficult to the point of being impossible. Much of what companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are working on remains unreleased. And executives are often opaque when asked what distinguishes their AI — Google CEO Sundar Pichai, for example, has taken to simply saying that the company has been working on it "for a very long time."Benedict Evans, the resident futurist at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said in a recent blog post that the future of AI remains opaque. "This field is moving so fast that it's not easy to say where the strongest leads necessarily are, nor to work out which things will be commodities and which will be strong points of difference," he wrote. "Though most of the primary computer science around these techniques is being published and open-sourced, the implementation is not trivial — these techniques are not necessarily commodities, yet."   Every major tech company is getting ready for this fight   Qi Lu is happy to make the case for Microsoft’s competitive advantage. Lu is one of the dozen people on Nadella’s senior leadership team, overseeing the company’s applications and service groups. He’s also a computer science PhD with 20 patents to his name, and is revered among the colleagues of his I speak to. After a few minutes, I start to understand why — he’s ferociously intelligent, tapping his feet impatiently as he talks, as if frustrated he can’t speak as quickly as he thinks. When we meet he is wearing socks with sandals, cargo shorts, and a T-shirt emblazoned with three words: "Make epic shit."Lu begins by running down the disadvantages presented by the first wave of the mobile internet. The percentage of web traffic from mobile devices has never exceeded desktop traffic he says, reflecting users’ frustration with the experience. "We know web doesn’t really work on the phone," Lu says. And outside a handful of major categories, users are resistant to downloading apps. Seattle residents might be asked to download an app just to check the fare of a ferry they take a couple times a year — surely there’s a better model. "Our industry hasn’t found an experience platform that can unleash the entire value of mobile and the cloud," Lu says. "Apps, fundamentally, are not the right model."Apps arose as an interface in lieu of the HTML-based web because they were the best we could do at the time. You couldn’t just yell what you wanted from the internet into your phone, so developers built sophisticated hidden plumbing and let you interact with it via big graphical buttons. And buttons remain the most efficient path for getting lots of things done. But thanks to advancements in natural language processing, now you actually can just yell what you want from the internet into your phone. Lu says the next-generation "experience platform" is going to start there, with conversation. It fits more naturally with how humans behave anyway. And if you get it right, you can always start layering those big shiny buttons back on later. "We see a full spectrum of using language as the baseline, but using graphical interactions in a thoughtful, meaningful way, to elevate the experience," he says. Piece it all together and you can see why Microsoft is feeling so optimistic But to win, Lu says, a company needs five "key assets." The first is a "conversation canvas" — a place where people are doing lots of talking and texting. Microsoft has Office, Outlook, Skype, and Cortana. The second is that AI "brain" — a sophisticated mental model of the world. Microsoft says its own AI efforts date back nearly 20 years. The third is access to a social graph — people’s activity on the internet often involves their friends and coworkers. Not coincidentally, a few days after I met Lu, Microsoft announced it would spend $26.2 billion to acquire LinkedIn, and its 433 million registered users.The fourth piece is a platform for the artificial intelligence to operate on. Microsoft has Windows and a family of devices, notably the Xbox. The final piece is a network of developers eager to build on your platform, and to pay you for the privilege. Stoking that interest had been the primary goal of the Microsoft Build developer conference in March.Individually, Microsoft’s assets have strong rivals. Facebook arguably has a stronger conversational canvas with its family of messaging apps, for example certainly it has the largest social graph. Google’s "brain" might be smarter, and it has broad access to hundreds of millions of Android devices. But piece it all together and you can see why Microsoft is feeling so optimistic. "Adding all those assets," Lu says, "I believe we have what it takes to lead the future."              The brainMicrosoft’s total embrace of AI became apparent two years ago at the inaugural Code Conference. (The conference was acquired the next year by Vox Media, which owns The Verge. ) Nadella, who had become CEO just three months before, appeared on stage to discuss Microsoft's future. At the end of his talk, he demonstrated a new feature inside Skype. Two Microsoft employees spoke on stage — one in English, the other in German — and Skype translated their speech in real time, allowing them to communicate despite the language barrier. It was an impressive demo — and Nadella announced that by the end of the year it would be a working product.To the Skype team back in Redmond, Nadella's timeline landed like a bombshell. "It was a complete surprise to me," says Peter Lee, a corporate vice president at Microsoft Research. "Satya really put us in jail with this Skype Translator thing." Initially, the team had two major concerns. One was that Microsoft Research historically has not been tasked with bringing products to market, and researchers worried they would suddenly have less freedom to pursue scientific breakthroughs. "Satya really put us in jail with this Skype Translator thing." The other concern was that at the time of the demo, Skype Translator wasn't very good. The company's language models had been built using a large body of formal speeches — testimony from the United Nations, for example. But two-way communication of the sort that Skype needs to translate is much different. There are more "disfluencies" — moments when the speaker trips over a word, or backs up to start a sentence over again. There's "code mixing" — when speakers use multiple languages in a single sentence, which is very common outside of English. Then there was the singing — apparently people are constantly singing to each other, and it turns out that computers have a very difficult time parsing it."Basically, nothing worked," Lee says. "What we had to do is re-train all our models." But Lee's team rallied, cheered on by Nadella, and released a preview that December. The product became widely (and freely) available the next year. Lee, who approvingly calls Nadella "an activist," says the project was exhilarating — eventually. "Imagine the dips in morale and fear when you realize none of this stuff is gonna work — you have to somehow get people past that," Lee says. "And when you do, you see amazing new things appearing."This doesn't feel like hyperbole. Microsoft can now translate conversations between eight different languages — 56 different combinations. And the underlying technology has implications that go beyond translation. You want to hear about a bot that's incredibly, even magically useful? Microsoft is beta-testing software that records business meetings and produces transcripts in real time. The same software can also, say, take an audio recording of an interview between two people and produce a transcript that distinguishes between the speakers — perhaps the single most desired piece of technology for any journalist who ever lived."I can’t tell you how dismaying it was when we found out stuff wasn’t working well for Skype Translator when we first embarked on that," Lee says. "But now that we’re climbing that mountain, we’re in possession of these speech and translation models, especially the speech models — they’re shockingly good."              Clippy's revengeIn the meantime, Microsoft is pouring AI resources into some of its biggest franchises: Windows and Office. One of the promises of AI is that it can anticipate your needs — it’s the foundational idea of Google Now, which presents you with traffic, weather, and sports scores the moment you unlock your phone.Microsoft is working to build this kind of AI into the desktop. Marcus Ash, who oversees the development of Cortana, showed me a mocked-up version of Windows that draws heavily on cloud-based inferences about what I might want to know. When Ash accesses the Start menu, Cortana appears with a series of suggested actions: names that are meaningful to you, documents you’ve used recently, and suggested translations for common French words. (The user here has an upcoming trip.) With your permission, Cortana incorporates data about your contacts, web search history, and app usage into its recommendations.   It isn’t as sexy as a general AI that anticipates your every need — but it’s here today               And it changes based on the time of day — app developers can signal that they’re useful in the morning, or around dinner time, for example. "This idea of using conversation, using contextual information about you, with your permission, to make you speedier and make you feel like you’re in control, that’s the stuff we get really excited about," Ash says. "A lot of our user experience work is around simplification, removing friction, and really showing the power of intelligence."One of Ash’s favorite examples is called "commitments." With your permission, Outlook can take note of the fact that your boss asked you to send her something by the end of the week — and automatically remind you if you fail to respond. "My life is pretty complicated, and I tend to forget things — especially in emails," Ash says. Recently he forgot to respond to a request from his own boss, he says, but Cortana notified in time for him to address it.I see more of this kind of thing when I meet with Kirk Koenigsbauer, corporate vice president of marketing for Office. He shows me a range of ways where intelligence is making Office easier to use. In September 2014 Microsoft introduced Delve, a kind of Fitbit for productivity that is included with Office 365. The app analyzes how much time you spend in email and in meetings, and highlights times on your calendar where you have extended periods of time to do more complicated, meaningful work. It tells you what percentage of people you sent an email to actually read it, and how quickly. It will suggest reaching out to colleagues that you haven’t emailed in a while. It even shows you response times for your colleagues, and for yourself.If your organization lives in Google Apps, as do many big Silicon Valley companies, browsing Delve felt like a revelation. You don’t have to be a numbers nerd to find this kind of information useful. If you’re a manager, Delve can tell you at a glance how much time you’ve spent with each of your employees over the past week. This kind of intelligence isn’t as sexy as a general AI that anticipates your every need — but it’s here today, it works, and it makes Google Apps look like a neglected backwater by comparison.              After six months of searching for a killer bot, I'm still bullish on the concept generally. The interactions they enable are vastly richer than the 1-800 numbers and forgotten small-business websites they will eventually replace. But I've been disappointed by much of what we’ve seen on platforms like Facebook Messenger and Telegram: at times they have felt like the slowest way to use the internet. Most seem barely more functional than SmarterChild-era bots on AOL Instant Messenger, and all the typing they require sends me screaming back to button-based graphical interfaces. For now the discussion around bots and AI remains driven by the industry's desire for a profitable new platform, rather than consumer demand for the services they provide.When bots do their work in the background, they can feel a little bit like magicCompanies' response to that problem so far has been, essentially, that they're working on it. "Like many of these advanced technologies, people assume it’s all here today," said Mike Schroepfer, chief technology officer at Facebook, when I asked him about it in May. "And there's a lot more technology and work to be developed. I think this will improve month over month, year over year."And yet visiting Microsoft made me wonder if I hadn’t been thinking about the subject in the wrong way. Chat-based interfaces are generally tedious. But the machine learning that powers them, applied to tools you’re already using, is really quite powerful. If Microsoft can infuse Delve-like intelligence into a wider range of services, it can reasonably say that it offers the most powerful productivity suite in the world. There will be tremendous value in that even if its vision of a massive platform for powering chatbots never materializes. And it may not — at this early stage, bots in the foreground too often feel frustratingly dumb. But when they do their work in the background, they can feel a little bit like magic.Illustrations by Pete Ryan. Edited by Dieter Bohn.CEO Satya Nadella’s vision for Microsoft
      My 1.5-year-old son has Coxsackie disease, which is very funny to say, but very unpleasant to have. He woke up this morning at 4.30AM. I didn't want to stay cooped up in the house, so after breakfast we went to the park. We were the only people there at daybreak, but the playground was teeming with birds and squirrels making a meal of the food scraps humans had left behind.I spotted a squirrel perched on a garbage can. He was up to his waist in a paper bag that had been wedged halfway into the overstuffed rubbish bin. Suddenly he emerged with a partly eaten slice of pizza in his mouth. My ten years of experience as a journalist kicked in. "People on the internet will find this funny," I thought, readying my smartphone. "I need to get a video." Pizza Squirrel, no doubt tired of the paparazzi, made a break for a nearby tree. I followed, leaving my son to amuse himself on a rusty tricycle. The noble beast settled in the crux of a low branch and got to work. I captured the moment on my iPhone, grabbed a choice frame of the footage, and tweeted it out.Captured in his natural environment, the rare and elusive Park Slope pizza squirrel pic.twitter.com/1mRIn77gPF— Ben Popper (@benpopper) June 30, 2016I had high hopes for Pizza Squirrel, following in the footsteps of true rodent celebrities like&ampnbspPizza Rat. But the initial burst of retweets and faves was small. Perhaps I had chosen the wrong filter, I thought, or erred by leaving my missive blank of a hashtag. Maybe it was just too damn early. A tweet too soon. Perhaps I should have used a GIF.            A little over an hour later, my managing editor TC Sottek, rubbing the crusts of a bountiful sleep from his eyes, saw Pizza Squirrel for the first time. His poetic response catalyzed the internet to action.@benpopper asdkljfhalsdkjfhalsdf— tc (@chillmage) June 30, 2016The snowball of virality was rolling now, gathering speed and size. Retweets and likes rained down from all directions. Soon, the local news outlet caught wind of the moment. And thus Pizza Squirrel graduated from social media to honest-to-god journalism.Park Slope Pizza Squirrel just wants a little privacy to eat his slice: https://t.co/wSNpJgwEkF Thanks, @benpopper pic.twitter.com/PTIs8i3fw3— DNAinfo New York (@DNAinfoNY) June 30, 2016I learned today that there is no cure for Cocksackie. The pestilient little virus must run its course, leaving my precious child with another restless night of fitful sleep. We'll be back at the park tomorrow morning, no doubt. Maybe I'll get lucky one more time.P.S. - eagle eyed viewers may claim that this Pizza Squirrel was not in Park Slope at all when I captured him on film. I cannot confirm or deny this accusation, as I always protect my sources.
      Former Ford engineer Kip Ewing is among the latest auto industry veterans to join Karma Automotive, the upstart electric car company built on the ashes of Fisker. The company is opening a new Troy, Michigan engineering center, an outpost of the company’s California headquarters and manufacturing operation.Karma has grown from 20 to 500 employees in two years. The company will ramp up its Michigan facility to 80 employees this year and plans to have a total of 150 people working out of Troy by next year. Ewing will serve as chief engineer and is among the most recent Karma hires that hail from the ranks of Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce, Tesla, Ford, FCA, and GM and will report to Darren Post, who is heading Karma’s engineering efforts. Ewing was on the Ford team that led the development of the 2017 Ford GT and its predecessor, and his May departure from Ford was a surprise.I spoke to Ewing recently about his new appointment. "When I interviewed with Tom Corcoran, our CEO, he asked me the question of why I wanted to leave Ford. My response was, ‘I think the right question is why would come to Karma?’ The plant they have, the financial backing they have, the leadership they’ve assembled has made it a really attractive opportunity," he says.                 Karma Automotive      Karma Automotive’s new manufacturing facility in Moreno Valley, California.  Karma Automotive is the direct descendent of Fisker Automotive, an ill-fated company founded by prolific auto designer Henrik Fisker that stopped making its beautiful-but-flawed cars in 2012. Chinese parts manufacturer Wanxiang later acquired Fisker and its battery supplier A123, and has quietly begun staffing up its operations, after changing its brand name to Karma. (Fisker himself is no longer involved in the company.)Karma Automotive is expected to introduce the Revero, a reengineered version of the original Fisker Karma, later this summer. "The product that will be revealed later this year will look very much like the original car," Ewing says. "Most of the changes will be in the quality and function of the vehicle — much more refinement and reliability. I think that’s a really important part of this story that we’re making a modern electric luxury car designed in America and made in an American plant."I also spoke with James Taylor, Karma’s chief marketing officer, and a former president of Cadillac. He told me he has led much of the company’s recruiting efforts over the past two years. "We’ve gone from 20 to 600 people to ramp up the critical resources to make what we believe is a sustainable car business. At the back end of that is Kip and bringing on some experienced serious engineering people to build out our ranks," he told me. Taylor says Karma has a new business structure and is not under pressure to bring a car to market at a rapid pace.  "Sounds corny but true — only when it’s ready is it ready. And we have a lot of funding in the bank for our next generation of products that assures our future," he adds. Karma is focused on beefing up its California plant and will source drivetrain components from BMW.  Fisker’s original plant was in Finland, which apparently accounted for some its manufacturing woes. The additional office in Detroit helps broaden the talent pool.                Photo by Harold Cunningham/Getty Images      A Fisker Karma at the Geneva Motor Show in 2013. Karma Automotive’s Revero is expected to look similar.  In contrast to several of the California-based EV companies chasing Tesla — including Faraday Future, NextEV, and Atieva — Karma is not emphasizing self-driving or connectivity, instead focusing on electric power and driving experience. "I literally had one of the customers say ‘I don’t want to drive an iPad,’" Taylor says. "They treat it as a sense of relaxation and enjoyment, almost old-school driving. You have to have adequate connectivity in the car, what’s expected in the ultra luxury segment. It’s not going to be overemphasized or a technical contest over who has the most buttons and the most features to be able to control."The Revero, like the Fisker Karma before it, will be an extended-range electric car, not a fully electric vehicle like the Tesla Model S.  The Revero will have new a wiring harness and electronic boxes. "A lot of unglamorous things that are under the skin that don’t make for big sexy car reveals, but are very important," Taylor says. Members of the original design team have stayed on the company, offering insight into its future design palette.Karma envisions itself as a driver’s electric car, which is appealing to engineers. "It’s a drop-dead gorgeous, beautiful vehicle that has proportions like no other and its still very much about engaging the driver in the experience, dynamically and visually," Ewing says. "We just want to build that up with a very unique perspective an opportunity space that no one else plays in."
      If you really want to break the pattern of glass and metal rectangles, your next smartphone could be circular. Monohm Inc. is finally taking&ampnbsppreorders on Indiegogo for the Runcible — the smartphone-slash-pocket-watch that we&ampnbspfirst saw at Mobile World Congress in 2015.The Runcible will start at $399, and Monohm plans to ship the devices this September. Monohm originally planned to take preorders for its funky little phone about a year ago, with the goal of shipping the devices by the end of 2015. But that was before the three-person company ran into two enormous problems.First, Monohm built the Runcible's entire software experience on the FirefoxOS platform, a philosophical choice meant to keep the device open to tinkerers. That involved finding a processor that would play nicely with FirefoxOS. But not long after that, the manufacturer killed production of that particular chip, hanging Monohm out to dry.It was a disruption, but it quickly became the least of Monohm's worries, because not long after that, Mozilla completely killed off FirefoxOS."I think we hit probably every possible obstacle that you can hit""I think we hit probably every possible obstacle that you can hit," Monohm co-founder and CEO Aubrey Anderson tells The Verge. "Indie hardware is really damn hard, but I think we’ve had it pretty rough even in that context."The company was at a stopping point, Anderson says. The disruptions were enough that George Arriola, another co-founder and the company’s chief product officer, left in favor of what Anderson calls "a real job" in order to continue supporting his family. (Arriola remains an investor and is still on the company's board.)But Anderson and Monohm’s chief technical officer Jason Proctor decided to soldier on. "We came out of a long, possibly whiskey-fueled session with the idea that we should just do it anyway, that we should find a way to pursue this project in spite of having no operating system and no chip," Anderson says. He and Proctor were able to stay afloat by self-funding the company, doing a lot of the heavy software lifting themselves, and hiring contractors for very specific parts of the rest of the Runcible's development.Wanting to stick with the open-source DNA of the project, the two decided to start rebuilding the Runcible’s operating system with Android. "I was initially a bit nervous to bet on Android because it’s such a moving target, but way down low it actually isn’t," says Anderson. "It’s pretty stable."The team took Android 5.1 and built an operating system called "BuniOS" on top of it using Intel’s Crosswalk web runtime. The project is based on a web engine (Blink) that was born out of the Chromium project — the open-source bedrock that the Chrome browser is built on. Anderson says that this architecture "screams" on Android devices, and sounds well-suited for the type of light interaction that the Runcible is supposed to be all about.The anti-smartphoneThat vision was originally laid out by Monohm at Mobile World Congress last year. The Runcible is not only supposed to look different from every smartphone on the market, but you’re supposed to interact with it in a completely different way. For one, Monohm wants you to use it less — in fact, the company’s press materials even go so far as to call it the "anti-smartphone."In practice, that means a few different things. The traditional mess of notifications gets replaced with what Monohm calls "clean summaries of our digital lives." The Runcible’s core features are also presented in different ways, like the camera, which has gesture-based controls or the maps application, which suggests more scenic (and less direct) travel routes. And it also means there will be less reliance on the enormous app ecosystems that power the experiences on iOS and Android. In fact, since the screen is round, the Runcible won't have access to the Google Play Store anyway, according to Anderson.If that makes your heart skip a beat, then the Runcible was probably never for you anyway. It’s clear that Monohm wants it to be an approachable device for anyone that picks it up, but the team’s also not catering to Twitter-obsessed power users. Its real focus with this initial preorder push is finding maker culture customers who might be willing to play around with what the Runcible can do, either on a hardware level or down at the level of the processor.But if you’re not a tinkerer and the idea of the Runcible holds some appeal, it’s worth knowing that the device has been significantly upgraded from the version we saw last year. It now comes with a Snapdragon 410 quad core processor, an Adreno 306 GPU, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, and a 7-megapixel camera. But the best upgrade is the screen: it’s still 2.5 inches, but the resolution has been bumped up to 640 x 640, good for about 256ppi.The company is also still stressing the ideas of sustainability and modularity. The $399 base model will come with a back made of recycled ocean plastic, and for $499, users can get one of the wooden backs we saw at MWC. (The wood was "sustainably harvested" from Mendocino County in northern California, of course.) Flip covers that could plug in to the charging port will eventually be available, as well as other accessories. And Anderson says all the hardware on the device has been designed so that, down the road, it can be repaired, or replaced for better parts."It has taken us a whole year to get our shit together, so now we need to sort of hedge our bets"The biggest unknown after all this time, Anderson says, is how many people actually want to buy a Runcible. "I don’t know if we’re going to be dealing with hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands," he says. "We have a sense of the enthusiasm and the people out there, but it has taken us a whole year to get our shit together, so now we need to sort of hedge our bets in terms of supply chain."Monohm will have a clear idea of that when the preorder window closes on June 30th, and at that point Anderson and Proctor will start figuring out things like what kinds of deals need to be made for LTE coverage around the world."We’re kind of turning that corner where we can start to operate like a more normal company," he says, "and that means Jason and I can finally go get some sleep."
      Uber is experimenting with a decidedly retro service: a telephone dispatch system that would allow people without smartphones to call a hotline and order an Uber ride, according to a transit official in Pinellas County, Florida. The system is being tested as a pilot program in conjunction with the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority, which plans to launch it on July 18th. The call-in feature is part of a local program that will grant publicly subsidized Uber rides to low-income residents who do not have cars or easy access to the area’s bus-based public transit system, according to Christopher Cochran, senior planner at the PSTA.The call-in feature signals that Uber is looking not only to expand its clientele beyond its smartphone wielding, tech-savvy customer base, but also that the ride-hailing giant hopes to be taken more seriously by public transit agencies as a complement — or even alternative — to existing mass transport options.The ride-hailing giant hopes to be taken more seriously by public transit agencies"What this reflects is that as Uber moves more into the public realm and begins offering its services to a broader audiences, it will have to evolve in a way that will move it away from its roots as a tech company," said Jacob Anbinder, a spokesperson for the TransitCenter, a foundation dedicated to expanding urban mobility. "The more that you involve yourself in public policy as a company, the more you’re going to have to expand your offerings to reach people who don’t have smartphones or don’t have the Uber app."In February, Pinellas County became the first transit agency in the country to subsidize Uber rides (as well as those from a local taxi service) to and from designated bus stations, in an attempt to make its transit system more accessible, according to Christopher Cochran, a senior planner at the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority.Under the new plan, "transit disadvantaged" residents, including those without the Uber app, will be granted a taxpayer-subsidized Uber ride each month to anywhere within the service area during daytime hours in the case that they are facing an urgent situation requiring transit, according to Cochran. The dispatcher will have the discretion to determine whether a situation qualifies as urgent and "life sustaining," and the program will cover things as minor as grocery shopping and as major as a medical emergency, Cochran says."What we're doing now is a proof of concept.""This is going to dramatically change the efficiency with which transit-disadvantaged people can access the system," Cochran says.  "There is no question that this is going to be much bigger than what there is now — what we're doing now is a proof of concept."With the pilot project, Cochran says the dispatch center will be run and funded by the PSTA, which last week received a $300,000 state grant that will subsidize Uber rides. Uber will provide  call-in software that will enable dispatchers to send Uber drivers to call-in customers, says Cochran. The county plans to pay Uber directly for the ride subsidies, which will cover everything beyond the three-dollar flat fee that qualifying riders will pay.Uber declined to provide any specifics in response to to a request for comment. "We are always exploring ways to make the Uber experience better for riders and drivers," an Uber spokesperson said in an email. "At any given time, cities pilot various features in an effort to improve how people get from A to B."The dispatch center will be run and funded by the county ​Cochran says that his agency turned to Uber after failing to pass a local one-cent sales tax that would have expanded traditional mass transit options by increasing bus service and creating a light rail system. The defeat of the penny tax also required the agency, facing a budget shortfall, to cut back existing bus service. Turning to Uber represented an opportunity to fill such gaps but also held the potential to reach new potential riders while also providing access to those without the Uber app, according to Cochran, who says that a similar Uber program has been previously utilized by businesses.For Anbinder, adoption of dispatch software could represent a consequential shift in Uber’s business model as its competition with the traditional taxi industry matures."What you’re seeing essentially is the convergence of two ends of this market where in places like New York and DC you’re seeing taxi companies adopt Uber-alternative apps that allow you to use your smartphone to hail a taxi on demand," said Anbinder. "And now you’re seeing Uber also move toward the middle by offering services that work like the taxis we’re used to."
      Earlier today, Donald Trump tweeted a screenshot from a flight simulator rendering of Redding Airport in California, apparently believing it was a freely available photograph of the airport itself. Now, the person who first took that screenshot has asked Trump to take the tweet down, claiming the Trump campaign has effectively stolen his property."I never gave them permission to use it," said Jeroen Doorman, who first posted the image as a thumbnail for a Flight Simulator X video on YouTube, the apparent source for Trump's tweet. "I’m not a big fan of any political game of any country and since he has a big pile of money he should be able to find other things to use that are not property of someone else." Doorman says he emailed Hope Hicks at the Trump campaign after the tweet went up. The tweet was removed shortly after.             The environment itself was made by OrbX, a company that&ampnbspdesigns flight simulation scenery, but OrbX itself has voiced no objections so far and Doorman isn't affiliated with the company. He's just a fan who wants to protect his work.Doorman also has no objection to Trump's policies per se he just wants to protect his property. "I don’t care about politicians and what they have to say," Doorman says. "I’m just that simple videomaking guy from the Netherlands."The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
      In its first five years, the Google Cultural Institute scanned and archived 200 works of art in super-high-resolution gigapixel images. Now in just the past few months, it has managed to scan another 1,000.The sudden expansion is thanks to a new camera developed by Google, simply called the Art Camera. It's designed to be far simpler to use than other camera setups, making it easier for museums and other institutions to start digitizing the art and documents in their collection. And critically, it's also much faster."The capture time has been reduced drastically," says Marzia Niccolai, technical program manager at the Cultural Institute. "Previously it could take almost a day to capture an image. To give you an idea, now if you have a one meter by one meter painting, it would take 30 minutes."                  The Art Camera's capture of Signac's "The Port of Rotterdam." (Image credit: Google Cultural Institute / Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen)After a few years of work, Google has built 20 units of the Art Camera and is lending them out for digitization. The camera works like this: it's set up in front of a wall where a painting is hung its operator then points the camera at each edge of the image once the camera knows how big of a space it's working with, it'll set off to work, automatically moving inch by inch, taking extreme closeups. Those closeups are then sent off to Google's servers to be turned into a single gigapixel file, ready to look at just a few hours later.Prior to the Art Camera, either the Cultural Institute or the organizations it worked with had to pay to bring in a third party with image-scanning equipment. Now that Google has its own cameras, the process also becomes much cheaper. It isn't charging organizations that want to use the camera, encouraging them to take advantage of it. Niccolai says that the Cultural Institute has already lent it out to organizations across the globe, including in Brazil, India, and Hong Kong.                  (Image credit: Google Cultural Institute)The Art Camera has some critical limitations, however. While it's a simple way to archive something mostly flat —&ampnbsplike a painting —&ampnbspit can't handle 3D objects or anything particularly large. For that, Google will still have to bring in other tech.The new scans are available&ampnbspat the Cultural Institute's website. Among them, you'll find works from Monet, O'Keeffe, and Van Gogh, alongside other well-known names.

      This week’s controversy over how Facebook programs its Trending Topics section has highlighted the company’s growing power over the distribution of news — and the fear that it might one day use that power toward partisan ends. Facebook denied a Gizmodo report in which an anonymous former contractor said he was told not to feature conservative-leaning topics inside the widget. But the revelation that Trending Topics were chosen with editorial input raised new questions about Facebook’s relationship with journalism. Is it a neutral platform, as it has long asserted, or it is gradually developing a set of editorial principles?Thursday marks the first anniversary of Instant Articles, Facebook’s quick-loading news format. Before the controversy over Trending Topics unfolded, I had pitched Facebook on a discussion about both Instant Articles and the company’s thinking around editorial values. In response, the company invited me to its headquarters in Menlo Park to meet with Will Cathcart, director of product management for the News Feed. It's arguably one of the most important jobs at the company, overseeing development of the company's most used&ampnbsp— and most profitable&ampnbsp— product. And while the company has not made any data available, it seems clear that the News Feed drives exponentially more traffic to news stories than the lower-profile Trending Topics,&ampnbspwhich is all but invisible on mobile devices. "We're not interested in adding our point of view"One of the more surprising things Cathcart told me is that the News Feed and Trending Topics are run by separate teams. News Feed drives the majority of consumption on Facebook, and while humans create the algorithms that feed it, they don’t offer oversight on individual topics. Trending Topics, on the other hand, is run by the company’s search team, and is meant to take the pulse of all current events. But on both fronts, Cathcart said, Facebook strives for neutrality. "We want this to show you what you’re most interested in," said Cathcart, who has worked at Facebook since 2010. "We’re not interested in adding our point of view — we actually don’t think that works for a billion people."Facebook critics say the company is naïve for asserting that it can deliver the news without bias, since its algorithms are written by people. Cathcart told me that at a high level, the product does have a point of view: it privileges posts that readers are likely to find "meaningful" over ones that are merely recent, as Twitter (mostly) does. It highlights posts that it believes to be "informative" in addition to those that are merely "entertaining," because the data suggests that users prefer it that way.But Facebook’s reach extends to so many people and countries and languages, that building editorial products that are curated by humans would not be feasible, Cathcart says. Facebook wants the News Feed to feel like it has been tailored to your unique set of interests. "We think about what we’re trying to do in a really personalized way," he says. "And so I think if you’re trying to build a product for over 1 billion people to be informed about the news that they care about, you can’t really be building a product that has judgments about particular issues, or particular publishers. Because that doesn’t match what 1 billion people around the world want." Trending Topics are less personalized by design&ampnbsp— they're meant to reflect activity on the platform&ampnbsp— but Facebook sees that as a math problem, rather than one to be solved with editorial judgment."You can't be building a product that has judgments about particular issues."I asked Cathcart whether in five years, Facebook was still likely to have editorial teams making the sorts of judgments that are currently made in Trending Topics. "We care about creating the product that people want," he says. "Whether or not we can do that entirely with automated systems, or it’s helpful to have people help, is actually just a detail." Cathcart played down the editorial influence of the current team, suggesting its primary role was bug-fixing — ensuring that related topics appear together as a single item, for example, or preventing the keyword "lunch" from trending every day around noon.But what about cases where people are obviously wrong? If 100 million people are posting, falsely, that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, does Facebook have a role to play in stopping that? "I think you already see that happen on the platform today," Cathcart says. "It doesn’t have anything to do with us — people post a lot of this stuff and talk about it, and other people post different points of view. And the nitty-gritty of the details of how we should be involved I actually think is less important than building a platform where if people want to talk about that, it’s really easy to talk about that and find different points of view."In the wake of Gizmodo’s story, the US Senate called on Facebook to provide more transparency into how it selects stories to be featured. I asked Cathcart about how Facebook views calls for transparency. "The general thing we’ve done over the past couple of years, in part in response to these questions and criticisms, is to try to be more transparent about how the News Feed works in general," he says. "We talk about the algorithms we use and why we use the algorithms we use, and why we change it we talk about when we change it. [We do] a bunch of whiteboard sessions where we go through, here are the top things that the algorithm looks at, and doing a blog post every time we make a substantive change to the News Feed. I think we’re trying to be a lot more transparent about it, without being able to point to for every specific person’s News Feed, what were all the decisions that went into it."To read the rest of my discussion with Cathcart,&ampnbspclick here.
      After months of delays, the 16-camera virtual reality rig that GoPro built with Google has finally shipped. GoPro tells&ampnbspThe Verge that Odyssey, as it's called, has made it out to the first few companies that were vetted as part of a "limited access" pilot program.GoPro declined to comment on the exact number of customers who have received or even applied to buy Odyssey, but did name VR production companies WEVR, VRSE, Specular Theory, Surreal, and Two Bit Circus as some of the first to receive the rig.Odyssey is not your everyday virtual reality capture device. The big, spaceship-like rig costs $15,000 and uses 16 cameras to shoot three-dimensional 360-degree video. The price tag includes 16 of the company's flagship Hero 4 Black cameras, a microphone, the rig structure itself, all the necessary cables, and a Pelican case, as well as a warranty, support, and access to Google's servers.A powerful option for companies with a budgetThat makes it an attractive option for all types of filmmakers and companies with a bit of a budget. For comparison, Nokia's all-in-one Hollywood-ready VR camera offers similar capabilities and costs $60,000. GoPro, meanwhile, also sells a six-camera rig (much more like the commonly used homebrew solutions) for $5,000, and other companies sell rigs for even less — albeit with little to no software support. Other high-end solutions, like the Jaunt One, have no publicly stated price.The camera rig was announced about a year ago at the Google I/O developer conference. It was part of Google's announcement of Jump, an entire ecosystem for virtual reality filmmaking. Until recently, filmmakers looking to shoot stereoscopic 360-degree video have had to hire outside companies or cobble together their own end-to-end solutions. Jump provides filmmakers with some autonomy they not only gain access to Google's servers, which automatically processes and stitches the VR footage, but the program also provides schematics for camera rigs.Odyssey was the first camera rig that was purposely built to be used with Jump. (To date, it still appears to be the only one.) GoPro started accepting applications back in September, but missed the originally promised ship date of November, and Recode reported last month that GoPro's talks with potential suitors "abruptly stalled" in January.GoPro tells The Verge that the delay happened because Odyssey just wasn't ready in time. "Odyssey is the industry’s only commercially available automatic sync and stitch, stereo, 360-degree video capture solution," a representative for the company says. "We will always take the time needed to give our customers the best products we can create."The company says it is still accepting applications on a rolling basis, but that the Odyssey rigs are shipping in waves as they are built. The unit shown above, photographed at GoPro's headquarters in San Mateo, California, is what's known as a "design validation test" unit, essentially the final version made before the company ramps up production.VIDEO: Google and GoPro announce the project at Google I/O 2015
      The rise of smartphones has transformed the way students communicate and entertain themselves. But the classrooms they spend so much of their time in remain stubbornly resistant to transformation. On one hand, technology has long had a home in classrooms — I learned to type on an Apple IIe in the late 1980s. But for most schools, the approach to teaching remains stubbornly one-size-fits-all: a single teacher delivering the same message to a group of about 30 students, regardless of their individual progress.Bill Gates is working to change all that. Through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Microsoft’s co-founder and chairman has invested more than $240 million to date in a developing field known as "personalized learning." It’s a diffuse set of initiatives, led mostly by private companies, to develop software that creates individual lesson plans for students based on their performance, coaching them through trouble spots until they have mastered the subject at hand. Teachers still play a central role in the classroom, but they do less lecturing and more one-on-one coaching. Developing software that creates individual lesson plansThe effort is led by a dizzying array of startups with terrible names — think "Learnosity" — but big companies are starting to pay attention. In 2014 Google launched Classroom, which lets teachers post class announcements, assign work to students, and collect and grade their assignments. And last year Facebook announced a partnership with Summit Public Schools, in which the Gates Foundation is an investor, to create personalized learning software and make it freely available.This week Gates spoke at the ASU GSV Summit, an education technology conference in San Diego. In a standing-room-only speech, he laid out the foundation’s vision for accelerating the adoption of personalized learning around the world. Gates asked investors to take a longer view in education than other fields, because of epic school district purchasing cycles. He asked school districts to speed up those cycles by using more pilot programs, and by supporting data standards that make it easy to compare the&ampnbspefficacy&ampnbspof different products. And Gates told entrepreneurs to invest in research around the efficacy of their products, producing data that will encourage other schools to adopt personalized approaches.Last year I wrote about Facebook’s efforts around personalized learning, and afterward Gates’ people invited me to speak with him about his evolving thinking about education. A few hours after his speech, Gates bounded into a hotel room on the 38th floor of the Manchester Grand Hyatt and sat in a chair by the window. We were joined by a Gates Foundation spokeswoman and, on the other side of the window, a lone seagull who observed our interview with great interest."It’s still early stages," Gates said about personalized learning. "In five years, 10 years from now, will it be highly penetrated? That’s not absolutely clear."This interview has been edited and condensed.Casey Newton: I think it’s fair to say that even people who love tech don’t always pay close attention to the ways it’s transforming education. So at a high level, what is personalized learning doing for students at the schools where it’s being tried? And what opportunities do you see it creating over time?"People progress at a different rate."Bill Gates: Well the term "personalized learning" doesn’t have an exact definition. In general, the idea is that people progress at a different rate. If you’re ahead of what’s being taught in the class, that’s not good, you get bored. If you’re behind, then they’re using terms and concepts that create a general impression of "Hey, I’m not good at this." And science and math in particular — if they’re talking about something you haven’t had the explanation on, you just really give up in that area. And there is no way that you are brought back into it.                Dean La Prairie, ASU GSV Summit  For me, one of the most interesting areas you’re focusing on is remedial education in community colleges. Kids are asked to spend lots of money on these classes, which don’t earn them any credit, and so they never get their degrees as a result. In your speech, you say institutions that use personalized learning software for remedial education see their completion rates double. How does this work? Why is this a problem that software has been better at solving than traditional methods?There’s a boundary between high school and college where the all-access colleges make you take an exam as you come in. And depending on what your math score or your reading or writing score is, if it’s low enough, then you get placed in the remedial class, and they re-teach you everything. They don’t tweak the results you got and say, "OK, you’re missing this part or this part." It’s just a binary "You’re OK, go ahead" or "You have to get in the class." And so that’s one of the reasons we have such high dropout rates in higher ed. If you use a personalized tool, you’d sit down and it would sort of figure out, "OK, fractions, variables, graphing." In math there’s a few hundred concepts and it would sort of see which ones are weak for you. And then you could move on to the normal courses in a variable amount, instead of taking a whole year for the remedial math. A lot of people could do it in even a month or two! And the idea of personalized learning is you always know yourself where you are on a topic, that you have the sense of what the tasks are, how much there’s left to do to achieve certain levels. So there is more personal agency.For the students who are falling behind, they’ll get more time with the teacher. And it’s very interesting to track, in a classroom like, that some kids go faster than others. But you have some variability where there’ll be one topic where some kids are going fast, and then different kids will have a hard time on another topic. It’s pretty obvious that in the one teacher, 30 kids-type classroom, there’s a lot of boredom in there."In the one teacher, 30-kids type classroom, there's a lot of boredom."So far, there aren’t many standards around what "personalized learning" software should look like or how it should work. Do you expect that a standard model will emerge over time, or will it always be in flux?Well, I think there, like you see in the textbook market, you end up with a few products with fairly good share. It used to be what you learned every year was different in the 50 states. And now we have this thing called the Common Core, which is not a curriculum, but a common set of knowledge that a 6th grader should have, that a 9th grader should have, and so on. And that means that somebody like a Khan Academy, who is trying to be a website that’s a resource that helps out with all of this, when they talk about 6th grade math, it makes sense to kids in all the Common Core states exactly what’s there, the way they do the notation, the way they order things.Today I sat with a lot of the venture capitalists who work in this field. The foundation supported a number of those. Our role in this is to facilitate the market, to make sure that if the product is good, there is really proof that it’s good. We’re just trying to drive toward the outcomes. There will be a mix of free software and paid-for software in this. The exact balance of that in different areas — it’s not clear what that will look like.Your speech touched on how noisy the field of "ed tech" is right now — tons of companies are building things, and if you’re a teacher or administrator, it can feel totally overwhelming. How do you make the case to teachers and administrators that personalized learning is something they should pursue now, instead of a few years down the road when the field is more mature?Well, the biggest single barrier was that telling kids to use to use digital devices outside of the classroom might discriminate against kids who might not have an internet or PC access. Now both the penetration rates of tablets and PCs are much higher, and some of this can be done on the phone screen. Deciding which things you need the big screen for versus which things work off the small screens — that’s an area of interesting activity. Like if you’re just practicing vocabulary on something like Duolingo, that works really well on the phone. If you’re watching a history lecture, maybe. Reading a textbook, maybe. I like big screens, but we gotta get to all the kids. In the US at least, assuming you have a smartphone, it works pretty well. So, the biggest barrier has largely come down."I like big screens, but we gotta get to all the kids."Discussions of personalized learning generally go out of their way to emphasize the importance of teachers. And yet in the personalized learning classrooms I’ve visited, teachers play a much different role in the classroom than the ones I grew up with. Teachers unions can be fierce opponents. How do you get them on your side?Well the world is not that different. You want to get rid of the drudgery pieces, like creating math homework and grading math homework. You know, teachers want to get in and help individual students, and so I don’t think it’s really a different skill set. Eventually the schools of education will expose people to these new learning models as they get really pervasive. So you’ll come in ready to go with these things. There may be a generation of teachers that doesn’t adopt these things. But certainly the younger teachers coming in, they’ve chosen to be in education, and they know this is part of it. For the K–12 teacher, it’s mostly eliminating the stuff they are not that enthused about doing.As you move up into higher ed, it gets more dramatic. Should big lectures [still] be done, with each school doing them differently? Or are you just licensing that, like you used to with textbooks, and so those big lectures are just kids watching video online? That’s, in a sense, a little more threatening, and the question of whether each institution should do its own lectures really does come up. That would be a big change to get rid of that. But there’s a lot of cost pressure [on schools]. And some of the super high-quality lectures, like Learning Company, are way above average. And so will people move to that? Will people resist that? That’s going on right now.Lately the tech world has been enthusiastic about artificial intelligence in general, and bots in particular. Microsoft, as you know, has recently made a significant investment in bots. What role do you see for AI in education?Take writing — some people scoff at it, but there’s early work to give people feedback about their writing that in the years ahead I think does have a lot of promise. It is very intensive to take a piece of writing and give somebody feedback to help them be a better writer. It’s not like mathematics, where you are checking against this black-and-white thing. So AI tutors, that’s one of the verticals that will be played with, is this whole dialogue richness."It could be completely free."Then you can have vertical tutors where, if you’re confused about a concept, it’s another level of interactivity. Today’s interactivity is ok, I answered a few questions wrong, so then it repeats the lecture. [With an AI tutor,] I can engage in a dialogue. You know, part of the reason I’m so willing to tackle new subjects is that for each of those subjects, if I get utterly confused, I know somebody I can send an email to, and they’ll straighten me out. If you can’t have somebody straighten you out, and say, is this as complicated as I think? Am I missing something here? Then you’re probably not as ambitious. For a lot of subjects, as they get older, people are not willing to take that learning risk where they are confused. The idea that you could talk to a [virtual] advisor that would understand different misconceptions and arbitrary linguistics around it, that’ll certainly come in the next decade. And they’ll be a very nice supplement. We already have online a bit of an ecosystem where you can go get a math tutor for a certain number of dollars per hour. But the beauty of this is it could be completely free.
      SmartThings has hired Robert Parker away from Amazon to oversee future hardware and software development as its new SVP of engineering. At Amazon, Parker served as a director of engineering, spending five years working on a number of the company's top projects, including Alexa, the Fire TV Stick, and Prime Music. Before that, he spent 18 years at Microsoft."SmartThings has this opportunity to really be the heart of your home."Now starting at SmartThings, Parker says he intends to apply his knowledge of building consumer-friendly products to the smart home market, which is in dire need of help. "I'm going to make something that is measurably better for your house," Parker says.Parker's plan is to amp up what SmartThings is already doing: connecting disparate gadgets in the cloud."SmartThings has this opportunity to really be the heart of your home," he says. "When I started talking to Alex [Hawkinson, SmartThings' CEO], one of the things that was really exciting to me was thinking about taking that experience to the next level."As we talk about SmartThings' future, the word Parker keeps coming back to is "guardrails." He wants to establish safeguards that'll help smart-home products work exactly how they're supposed to (or that'll at least help you figure out what's wrong when something breaks). "Having something that really works is critical," Parker says. "That's one of the things that working at Amazon, I carry to SmartThings."It sounds like that future will essentially look like a more serious SmartThings certification system, which will require compatible products and apps to provide more information to its cloud. The changes should give SmartThings a clearer look at what's happening in each home.                  "Openness has really allowed people to participate," Parker says, referring to the&ampnbsp30,000&ampnbspdevelopers working in SmartThings ecosystem. "The next step is to sit there and say, 'now that you're participating, let's making sure that we help the ecosystem as a whole get better, work better, be more reliable, and be more scalable.'"This might sound somewhat sacrilegious from SmartThings. Since its inception, SmartThings has always prided itself on complying with open smart-home standards that anyone can be a part of — setting up SmartThings-specific standards seemingly starts to undermine that.Even as it adds constraints, SmartThings intends to stay open"It's gonna be consistent with the vision we have today," SmartThings CEO Alex Hawkinson says. "But I want to see us be the leader in providing an environment that has guarantees around how well [smart home] devices can come to work for the consumer."Neither Hawkinson nor Parker would detail precisely how SmartThings' "guardrails" will work, but they indicated that the company hopes to build on top of the existing open standards. So, theoretically, these products will still work with other smart-home systems they'll just work better with SmartThings.The coming changes, Hawkinson says, are about making the smart home "very accessible, simple, and reliable for consumers."Samsung's Developer Conference kicks off on Wednesday, and SmartThings will certainly have a role to play there. Samsung is starting to integrate SmartThings with its high-end TVs, and it's promised to make all of its products part of the IoT by 2020.The changes will roll out over 2016SmartThings indicated that its updated strategy wouldn't be rolling out all at once — we may not see any part of it this week. But over the course of this year, expect to see SmartThings new strategy begin to roll out.With Samsung at its back, SmartThings is well positioned to start opening up smart-home products to more people. But its plans for accessibility speak to broader threats in the market. Closed smart-home ecosystems, from companies like Apple and Google, could grow quickly and offer a smoother experience. And as a wholly open ecosystem, SmartThings' place at the "heart of your home" could easily be replaced by Wink, or any number of other competing products.It sounds like, over the next year, we'll see how SmartThings intends to deal with those two issues. Taking them on by making smart home products work better certainly isn't a bad idea.
      Add Ford to the list of companies that are being pillaged by Uber in its quest to excel in the hyper-competitive world of self-driving cars. Sherif Marakby, director of global electronics and engineering at Ford, is joining Uber as vice president of global vehicle programs, the ride-hail company told The Verge Thursday. Marakby will relocate from Detroit to Pittsburgh, where Uber is&ampnbspbusy expanding its Advanced Technologies Center.In Pittsburgh, Marakby will oversee "manufacturer strategy and integration efforts," which may or may not include the actual construction of autonomous vehicles. (Uber wouldn't say whether its building its own self-driving cars, although the company is said to be&ampnbspshopping for a fleet of vehicles in Germany.) He'll report to Brian McClendon, who was a vice president at Google in charge of the mapping division before leaving the search giant to run Uber's self-driving car program. "Self-driving technology is a hard challenge to solve with enormous potential to improve people's lives," McClendon said in a statement. "Sherif is a world expert and we're excited to have him join the team.""Self-driving technology can help prevent these tragedies as well as improve the quality of life in cities."In his own statement, Marakby framed his decision to jump from the traditional auto industry to a company that aims to upend that world as one motivated by safety. "Over one million people die in car accidents every year — €”in the US it's the most common cause of death amongst young people," he said. "Self-driving technology can help prevent these tragedies as well as improve the quality of life in cities. It's one of the many reasons I am so excited to join Uber's team in Pittsburgh."Uber has been wooing engineers and self-driving car experts to join its Pittsburgh operation for months now. In addition to McClendon, Google Maps product manager&ampnbspManik Gupta jumped to Uber's mapping division late last year. Last May, the $62.5 billion startup pretty much&ampnbspcleaned out the entire robotics research unit at Carnegie Mellon University.A few months later, it&ampnbspstruck a partnership with the University of Arizona to develop self-driving technology, particularly the mapping and optics challenges involved in developing a fully autonomous vehicle. Interestingly enough, Google just announced it would be&ampnbsptesting its own self-driving cars in Phoenix.
      When I tried Microsoft’s HoloLens headset last year, security guards lined the walls of a hotel, and I had to stash all my belongings in a locker before I even set foot near it. Microsoft was petrified someone would take a photo of the device and deconstruct it to help rival companies catch up. Fast forward a year and a lot has changed. Microsoft is now shipping HoloLens development editions to app and game developers, and it’s ready to give the world a much closer look at the headset. I got the chance to look at exactly what goes inside Microsoft’s HoloLens, and the company supplied me with all of the HoloLens parts on a table — even the screws that hold it all together. Here’s a close look at all the tiny HoloLens components that make Star Wars-like holograms possible in your own living room.  Opening up the HoloLens is a startling reminder that this is a self-contained holographic computer. Unlike the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive VR headsets, it’s completely untethered and doesn’t need to communicate with a PC or phone to project holograms into the environment around you. It's a Windows 10 PC that sits on your head. That’s impressive in itself, but it wasn’t always that way. Microsoft has spent years refining the headset and associated hardware so you don’t need a giant PC to use it. The first time I used HoloLens in January last year, I had to hang a miniature PC around my neck. It has come a long way since those early units.The magic of HoloLens is a combination of see-through holographic lenses, an array of sensors, and the processing required to understand your gestures, gaze, voice, and the environment around you. It’s tempting to compare it to the work Google did with its Glass project, but the HoloLens is trying something different and it feels more immersive as a result. This headset understands the objects in your living room, and it projects holograms into your eyes that don’t jerk around. I played a Conker game and the squirrel literally climbed up a coffee table and ran across pillows. It really felt, at times, like Conker was in the room with me.            An important part of the HoloLens is the depth sensing camera that sits above the visor at the front of the headset. It’s essentially a miniature version of the Kinect camera that only needs about a tenth of the power, and it looks like a regular camera from the outside. "It is engineered and designed by Microsoft," explains Microsoft’s Ori Amiga, who has been working on the headset for years. Microsoft doesn’t usually engineer and manufacture hardware chips and parts, so this is relatively unusual for the company. As you’re gesturing around with your fingers, the depth camera senses exactly where your hand is, and whether you’re using your left or right hand.Microsoft's HoloLens cameras sense the world around themThe depth sensing camera works in tandem with two "environment understanding" cameras on either side of the HoloLens. These also look like regular cameras from the outside of the headset, but they’re used to capture the world around you and help HoloLens understand where your walls and coffee table are. There’s also a 2-megapixel video camera at the front so you can record exactly what you see with the holograms included. Microsoft calls this mixed reality capture, and it’s a fun way to record what you see with the holograms that are being projected into your living room. During my HoloLens hands-on, I found myself activating the feature a lot (using Cortana, of course). I can imagine a lot of people are going to have fun sharing clips to Facebook and Twitter.                                                   This is just the first generation So the cameras help HoloLens see, but the real magic is how holograms are projected into your vision. The HoloLens optics system is composed of see-through holographic lenses (Microsoft refers to them as "waveguides") that use an optical projection system to beam holograms into your eyes. These look like regular glasses when you pull them out of the visor, and it’s easy to imagine a future where just these glasses are the entirety of HoloLens. While traditional smartphones have displays measured in pixels, Microsoft is counting light points to boost HoloLens’ resolution and the number of light points per radian for density. Essentially, more radiants and light points mean holograms are brighter and richer. These bright and rich holograms are projected and bounced around as particles of light (photons) through the waveguides and into your eyes. I’ve used the HoloLens three times now, and I’m convinced this latest version has sharper text rendering. Amiga couldn’t comment on exactly what Microsoft has improved over the past year, but a combination of hardware and software tweaks have definitely made holograms crisper.The holographic lenses are also the source of some HoloLens complaints. The device has a limited field of view, and it’s an optical limitation that won’t change much, if at all, by the time this ships to actual consumers. Microsoft is using a transparent display, and holograms need to be projected into your eyes. It’s still a challenge for the HoloLens and other head-mounted augmented reality devices to cover your entire eye as you move your pupil around. It could take years before this field of view greatly improves, but this is just the first generation.Perhaps the most impressive part of the HoloLens is its motherboard. Unlike a powerful gaming PC or even your average laptop, it’s tiny and uniquely shaped for the HoloLens. I was surprised at just how small it is. "I’m not sure you’ve ever seen a motherboard that isn’t rectangular or square, but it’s not easy," explains Amiga. Microsoft has packed everything into this motherboard. The CPU (32bit Intel-based), GPU, flash memory, RAM, Wi-Fi chip, and Bluetooth chip are all on this tiny little board. There’s also a new chip on this HoloLens motherboard: the holographic processing unit (HPU)."We believe that it’s time for the world to get the third processor, so you’ll have a CPU, GPU, and a HPU," says Amiga. The HPU does a lot of the heavy lifting here, so that the CPU and GPU are able to just launch apps and display the holograms. Microsoft custom designed the HPU and it’s really meant to take all of the data from the cameras and sensors and process it in real-time so you can use gestures accurately.            All of these sensors need battery power, and Microsoft has packed a bunch into the rear of the headset. There are three separate batteries on each side of the HoloLens, but Microsoft isn’t revealing their exact capacity yet. They look like little battery packs you might use inside a toy, and they’re small enough to fit in the sides of the HoloLens. They also act as a way to balance out the weight of the HoloLens so it doesn’t feel too heavy at the front or rear. The headset should run for around two or three hours before it needs to be recharged via Micro USB.One of the final parts of the HoloLens is the spatial sound. This works through two speakers that are positioned just above your ears as you wear the headset. Apps and games can take advantage of this to make enemies sound like they’re behind you instead of having to load up visual elements to make you turn around. I’m surprised at just how well this works. It sounds like you’re wearing headphones, but you’re not. Even at full volume, it’s hard for others around you to hear it, so it’s not going to irritate people in a room. You can adjust the volume at the side, and even plug in headphones to get the same spatial effect.Spatial sound is an impressive part of HoloLensMicrosoft is now shipping all of this hardware to developers for $3,000. The software giant isn’t discussing exactly when consumers will be able to experience HoloLens, but it’s likely that the final hardware will differ from what we see today. It took Microsoft several years to shrink this into a unit you can wear on your head, so the hope is that more breakthroughs and time will allow it to shrink this down even further. Developers will now shape the future of the HoloLens software and experiences, and perhaps even its hardware.

      Ticketmaster is officially launching its first set of public APIs and SDKs, which will allow third-party apps to integrate its ticket discovery, purchasing, and management services directly into their app. The tools are available through Ticketmaster's new&ampnbspdeveloper portal."We want to explore new partnerships with big brands and startups," Ismail El Shareef, VP of open platform and innovation at Ticketmaster told The Verge. "Anyone out there who wants to build an innovative live event experience for fans, we are in the market to work with and help them succeed with using our data."The two main APIs Ticketmaster is releasing this week are a discovery API and a transactional API. Discovery will allow developers to include Ticketmaster’s lineup of events directly into their apps, and the transactional API will let users purchase tickets through third-party apps. Ticketmaster is also introducing a set of native SDKs for iOS and Android to allow for ticket management, including transferring and selling tickets to other users.The first wave of partners will include Fox Sports, Facebook, Tidal, Broadway.com, and Bandsintown, which is the&ampnbspfirst app to use Ticketmaster’s transactional API. During your first transaction with an app using Ticketmaster's APIs, your accounts will be linked so you don’t have to authenticate every time you want to manage your tickets or make a purchase in that particular app. Fox Sports, Facebook, Tidal, and Broadway.com are among the first partnersThe ticketing service and Live Nation subsidiary has shared its private API with a select group of companies, including Groupon and ScoreBig, for some time, but that API was designed for internal use, and was complicated for external developers to understand and integrate. Instead of building in more workarounds, Ticketmaster decided to build an entirely new set of APIs from the ground up with&ampnbspApigee, an API management firm whose clients include eBay and Adobe.Jared Smith, Ticketmaster’s president of North America, tells me that the company has been working on updating its platform for the past few years. "We had to build some new capabilities. We had to be a modern platform that had modern infrastructure to be more nimble and more flexible in today's economy," Smith said. "We’ve done a lot of investment, specifically over the past two to three years, to open up the platform and make our core capabilities available to other to compliment our services."Ticketmaster switching to a public API is potentially a big deal for apps focused on sports and music. Apps like ESPN could offer ticketing options for every major sports league, and music-streaming services could become a one-stop shop for all your music needs, something a few streaming services have been trying to achieve with varied success."We had to build some new capabilities."Spotify recently integrated Songkick into its apps, and Tidal has partnered with Ticketmaster to give subscribers early access to some tickets (neither support in-app purchasing). Pandora took it a step further and spent $450 million to acquire TicketFly in a bid to compete directly with Ticketmaster. The deal still may pan out well for the company, but if other streaming services like Apple Music and SoundCloud end up offering just about every major concert thanks to Ticketmaster integration, it becomes a far less unique advantage.While sports and music are two of Ticketmaster’s key categories,&ampnbspthe company is looking to introduce its ticket offerings into new categories of apps where it hasn’t gained a foothold yet, like social media and travel."Certainly social is ripe for opportunity across a dozen different partners in that space," Smith told me. Ticketmaster already provides its API to Facebook to power live event pages for artists, and Twitter could be next. Ticketmaster’s API could allow social networks like Twitter to do things like integrate in-app ticket purchasing into search results or Moments, when a big game or concert becomes the talk of Sports and Music Twitter.Smith says travel is also a category that Ticketmaster could venture into thanks to new integration opportunities provided by the API. "Travel is a huge category that we think could be really interesting to us," Smith told me. "There’s not a great set of partners out there that are looking at, 'Hey I’m going to be in New York, could I add on event tickets to my purchase,' or 'I’m going on vacation and I want to to book all that stuff at once.'" Smith added, "We’re really taking a broad view to it from a category perspective and saying, how can we make a mix of these things that really helps us solve our issues."Ticketmaster's API could take away the advantage from streaming services, like Pandora and Spotify, with ticketing optionsThe two biggest problems Smith sees facing Ticketmaster are bots and brokers who buy up tickets in bulk and resell them on the secondary market to the detriment of the actual consumer. When tickets went on sale for Adele’s tour this past December, Ticketmaster had over 10 million requests for just over 400,000 tickets. Many of those requests were from brokers and bots looking to sell the tickets at a higher price. Smith believes that tickets are underpriced for many major events and that the low prices spur on brokers and end up costing the consumer more in the long run."Generally speaking, the industry underprices its tickets, by and large. It doesn’t have a big enough spread between really, really premium prices, and really, really affordable value prices," Smith said. Ticketmaster’s public API means more apps can tap into it, and more apps means improved consumer awareness for ticket availability. If Ticketmaster can get its product in front of a bigger and more diverse group of actual consumers, it believes it will help avoid scalpers and eventually properly set pricing for the market."If you can attack the actual disease which is pricing inefficiencies you can actually take away a lot of that traffic which is there only because [brokers] think they can arbitrage them," Smith said.
      Google has been developing a third-party keyboard for iOS that would put the company’s search engine in a highly used part of the interface, The Verge has learned. The keyboard, which incorporates a variety of search options, has been in development for months, according to people familiar with the matter. It’s unclear whether or when Google plans to release it. The company declined to comment. The Google keyboard incorporates a number of features meant to distinguish it from the stock iOS keyboard. Like its Android counterpart, the Google keyboard for iOS employs gesture-based typing, so you can slide your finger from one letter to the next and let Google guess your intended word. Tap the Google logo and you can access traditional web search. It also appears to have distinct buttons for pictures and GIF searches, both presumably powered by Google image search. The keyboard is visually distinct from the standard&ampnbspAndroid keyboard, which incorporates voice search but no text or image-based searching.            Google Keyboard for Android The keyboard, which has been in circulation among employees for months, is designed to boost the number of Google searches on iOS. While the company all but holds a monopoly on the global search market, there’s evidence that mobile search is proving much less lucrative for Google than the desktop. Using publicly available numbers, journalist Charles Arthur argued in October that&ampnbsphalf of smartphone users perform zero searches per day. (Using the same math, Arthur said desktop users perform an average of 1.23 searches per day.)Even if the math is inexact, the trend is inarguable. A high percentage of desktop searches are for keywords like "Facebook" or "Gmail" — searches that are unnecessary on mobile phones, where users can simply tap on the relevant app to launch it. The problem for Google — and for Alphabet, its parent company — is that search is where Google shows users its most expensive ads. Any sign of decline in search would be an existential threat to the company.All of which makes an iOS keyboard feel inevitable. But it remains to be seen whether iOS users have an appetite for Google’s approach to typing. Third-party keyboards have generally been a disappointment on iPhones and iPads. When users have more than one installed, they must constantly cycle through them. Many third-party keyboards have also suffered from sluggishness and other performance issues.But Google’s brand is strong, and for users who perform many searches per day — or simply want a solid gesture-based system for text entry — the Google keyboard could be appealing. The only question now is whether, or when, the company plans to release it.Correction, 7:12 p.m.: This article originally stated that third-party iOS keyboards could not be set as default keyboards.
      Yesterday, the government made a surprising retreat in the San Bernardino encryption case, after an unnamed source revealed a new method of breaking iPhone lockscreen protections. After a hastily assembled conference call, the parties agreed to put the court order on hold until it could be determined whether Apple's help was still necessary.But excerpts from a court transcript of that proceeding, published here for the first time, show the government was far less prepared for the new method than some have assumed. "We only learned about this possibility today, this morning," Assistant US Attorney Tracy Wilkison told the judge in the conference call. "We have a good faith basis at this point in order to bring it up." That timeline is consistent with recent court filings, which show the first successful demonstration of the method coming that Sunday. The transcript also shows both confidence and uncertainty over whether the new method will work. "There have been a lot of people who have reached out to us during this litigation with proposed alternate methods, and one by one they have failed for one reason or the other," Wilkison says. "At this point we have, at least, a good faith basis that it will work. The problem is we don't know for sure." As a result of that uncertainty, the government argued to stay the initial order rather than vacate it, a request that was subsequently granted by the court.The initial argument comes from Apple's Ted Boutros, requesting a complete dismissal of the order:We have had a chance now to think this for about an hour, and we, obviously, defer to how the Court would like to proceed. We would not object to the hearing being postponed and moved because — and we request that the Court vacate the order that was entered ex parte.  If the Court will recall, in the order — in the ex parte application the Government represented that the assistance sought could only be provided by Apple. And Agent Pluhar's declaration at paragraph 4 said that — testified that he'd explored other means, and the Government had been unable to identify any other methods feasible for gaining access. So the order was based on good cause. And we, respectfully, submit that there no longer is good cause.The relevant rebuttal from Wilkison is reproduced in full below:Your Honor, the Government's number one priority throughout this entire investigation has always been to gain access into the phone and we sought as a matter of necessity and not of choice. That said, we have been working tirelessly during this entire time to see if there's another way to do this, but I don't think we're there yet. We only learned about this possibility today, this morning, about this possibility that Apple is not necessary. And we have a good faith basis at this point in order to bring it up. There have been a lot of people who have reached out to us during this litigation with proposed alternate methods, and one by one they have failed for one reason or the other. And we haven't, you know, — there's just no reason to go into those.But at this point we have, at least, a good faith basis that it will work. The problem is we don't know for sure. And while — if it's validated, the Court could then vacate the order. I think we are really premature to vacate the Court's order at this point because there's also the possibility that it will not work. I think we should just give the experts the time that they need to test it and let us report back to the court.
      Matt McRae is fired up about remote controls. Or, more specifically, about getting rid of them.McRae is the chief technology officer of Vizio, a company that sells more TVs — and with them, remotes — than any other company in America. And he thinks remote controls are very, very stupid.“I can’t believe we have rubber buttons and a plastic housing with double-A batteries,” he says. “We’re navigating from remotes that were invented in the 1950s. That needs to be dynamited.”             Remote, ControlledHow Vizio and Google radically reinvented the TVBy Nilay Patel | Photography by Paul Barshon Matt McRae is fired up about remote controls. Or, more specifically, about getting rid of them.McRae is the chief technology officer of Vizio, a company that sells more TVs — and with them, remotes — than any other company in America. And he thinks remote controls are very, very stupid."I can’t believe we have rubber buttons and a plastic housing with double-A batteries," he says. "We’re navigating from remotes that were invented in the 1950s. That needs to be dynamited."What if all the TVs in your home were just extensions of your phone?And McRae has dynamite in hand. Vizio’s new P-Series TVs are a radical departure from the rest of the industry. Unlike the smart TVs that dominate the market, the P-Series completely lacks an on-screen interface — there are no apps or menus or controls or even picture settings on the TV itself. There’s nothing.Instead, Vizio has partnered with Google to redesign the entire TV experience around the Google Cast streaming protocol, the same technology used in the wildly popular Chromecast streaming stick. The P-Series comes with a six-inch Android tablet, and everything is controlled by the new Vizio SmartCast app. There’s also an iOS version of the app, and any other app or service that supports Cast can send content to the TV.It's a simple idea with enormous implications: what if all the TVs in your home were just extensions of your phone?"The era of having a couple of buttons on a physical remote that sits there and does nothing else is going to end," says McRae, his voice rising. "We’re the ones who are going to end it."            Vizio chief technology officer Matt McRaePeople have been trying to smash computers and televisions together since the ‘80s, a concept generally called "smart TV." Hang out with people building smart TV interfaces long enough, and you’ll notice an entire language has evolved around it. They talk about "leaning back versus leaning forward" and solving "10-foot interface issues" and "replacing input one" and a host of other terms that all revolve around a single problem no one has ever managed to really solve:Navigating TV interfaces sucks."A better remote control is not the answer." It’s particularly awful if you have to hunt and peck with cursor keys on a regular remote, but no other solution is that much better. It doesn’t matter if you ship a full-size keyboard with a trackpad, like Sony and Logitech have done in the past. It doesn’t matter if you stick a bunch of QWERTY keys on a regular remote to make typing easier, like TiVo and Vizio have each tried. It doesn’t matter if you build the world’s sleekest touch remote and ask people to use apps on the screen, like the new Apple TV. It doesn’t matter if you go all-in on voice search and let people just ask for what they want, like Roku and Amazon and a host of others are doing. None of these ideas have ever cracked the fundamental problem: TVs are for watching things, not doing them."A better remote control is not the answer," says McRae. "That’s the wrong way to think about it. We’ve done touchpad remotes. We’ve done keyboards. We’ve prototyped motion sensing. We’ve gone down all those paths and we think they’re all cul-de-sacs. The answer is to get rid of the remote control as a device category. Any screen should be a remote control."Vizio is a quiet company —&ampnbspmost people don’t even realize that it’s based in America, headquartered in Irvine, California. It’s also a tiny company, with just about 450 employees. Yet by designing products in the States and leveraging tight relationships with manufacturing partners like AmTran and Hon Hai to undercut competitors’ pricing, Vizio has come to dominate the US TV market in recent years. Vizio TVs routinely sit atop the charts at review sites like CNET and The Wirecutter, and the company currently leads in both smart TV and overall TV unit shares over rivals like Samsung and Sony. The company doesn’t spend a ton on marketing, instead focusing on what it calls the "reco rate," or how likely Vizio owners are to recommend the products to their family and friends. McRae proudly says it’s the highest in the industry.But over time, Vizio’s Yahoo-based VIA Apps smart TV platform had become dated the company needed a new platform. The company could have picked any number of other smart TV solutions — including Google’s own Android TV — but McRae wanted to do something more radical: try and reset the entire model of how people interact with the screens in their lives."The mental and strategic leap is breaking up navigation and consumption," he says. "A handheld device has proven to be an extraordinarily adept navigation device, and it has become an extraordinarily personalized experience. That is not something a television hanging on a wall ten feet away from you will ever be. A TV should be focused on rendering video in the most perfect way possible."            The company’s solution is the Vizio Tablet Remote, which isn’t a remote at all: it’s a six-inch tablet running stock Android Lollipop on an eight-core Snapdragon processor with a very nice 1080p screen, a soft-touch back, dual speakers, and a wireless charging cradle. It lacks any dedicated buttons to control the TV — it only turns into a "remote" when you open Vizio’s new SmartCast app or kick off a streaming session from another app that supports Cast, like Hulu or Netflix.But you don’t have to cast anything to the TV at all — after all, it’s just an Android tablet. You can go ahead and watch Netflix on the Smart Remote if you want. You can download apps from the Play Store. You can cast Netflix to the TV and use the tablet to check Twitter. You can let a kid play games on the tablet and control the entire TV with the SmartCast app on your iPhone. The tablet is basically another small TV.The tablet is basically another small TVThis seemingly simple approach represents a complete reversal of the industry-standard idea that mobile devices are "second screens" in the living room — the phone in your hand showing your Twitter while you watch Game of Thrones on TV, for example."Vizio understood the power of bringing the interaction model to the second screen," says Mario Queiroz, the Google VP in charge of Cast. "They understood the ability they would have to build a lot of experiences you couldn’t build on the first screen."With the new P-Series, the Vizio tablet remote is the first screen, and the 4K HDR television is the second.It’s hard not to contrast Vizio’s kill-the-remote strategy against Apple’s new Apple TV, which is entirely built around the new touch-based Siri Remote. Apple is extending iOS into the traditional first screen TV interface Vizio wants to erase that interface entirely. "Companies that are newer to the living room space have yet to go all the way down to the end of the cul-de-sac, but they will," says McRae when I ask him about Apple. "They’ll get there and they’ll realize that they’re stuck, and no matter what you do with a tiny little remote control in your hand, you’re not going to be able to provide the advanced navigation consumers demand from apps and services."            Vizio's McRae, design VP Scott McManigal and software and services head Bill Baxter look at a prototype SmartCast speaker.Work on the P-Series started two years ago, after Google first introduced the popular Chromecast streaming stick. Vizio had already built an Android TV streaming box called the Co-Star, and quickly reached out to Google’s Cast team. "It was kind of a meeting in the lobby, just very quickly, because we’d been working with that team," says McRae.Vizio wanted to use Cast as the platform to power its next generation of televisions, but there was a lot of work to be done: Cast didn’t support actually running a TV. It also didn’t support two major innovations Vizio was keen on introducing: 4K streaming and the new Dolby Vision high dynamic range standard, both of which represent major upgrades over standard TVs. "It’s not like a physical dongle just slapped in the back," says McRae. "It was actually a very deep integration. You want to be able to cast right on top of HDMI 1 and have it seamlessly switch.""Their product will get better and better over time.""The Cast software is interacting directly with the TV firmware," says Queiroz. "Our experience with Chromecast significantly helped with building the Vizio TV experience, and what we’re learning with working with a partner like Vizio will definitely help us with the Chromecast lineup."Vizio and Google worked closely to extend the capabilities of Cast, eventually building an entirely new framework for Cast that let it hook into the P-Series while allowing Vizio’s code to control things like technical picture settings. Both sides were wary of creating another variant of Cast, confusing or fragmenting one of the largest streaming platforms on the market.The work eventually led to a unique system design: Google actually controls the Cast software on the P-Series, which is kept separate from the rest of Vizio’s software. "It will stay completely up to date with all the Chromecast dongles in the field," says McRae. "Google has the ability to update the Cast library at will.""All of the innovation we’re putting into Google Cast will be fed into the Vizio TVs, just as it is with the Chromecast. Their product will get better and better over time," says Queiroz. "We’re constantly updating the platform." The updates won’t all happen simultaneously, but Queiroz says one of Google’s goals is to keep the entire Cast ecosystem "pure" and in sync with feature updates."We’re building a great Cast experience, and they’re building a great TV," says Queiroz. Google is open to other TV makers using Cast in the same way, but the company started with Vizio because they "really wanted to get it right.""We’re at the very start of this, but we think there’s a lot more we can do," Queiroz says. "There’s a really huge ecosystem we can build here."And building a huge ecosystem around a platform is the entire game in television right now.            This is an all-out smart TV platform warVizio filed to go public last year, and the company’s S-1 filing suggest that it was platform concerns that prompted McRae and his team to run away from a traditional smart TV platform strategy. "We do not currently have arrangements with all of the popular content providers, including some content providers that are available on competitive devices, such as ESPN and HBO GO," the filing states in its risks section. "Furthermore, our arrangements with our current content providers typically involve no significant long-term commitments… if we are unable to provide a competitive entertainment offering through our smart TV discovery and engagement software, our ability to attract and retain consumers would be harmed."Meaning: Vizio’s current smart TV platform doesn’t have some of the most popular services, and there’s no guarantee any services will be available in the future. And the problem is getting worse: it’s hard to imagine any video service having the time, resources, or desire to create apps for every platform in the massively fragmented smart TV landscape.Samsung TVs run Tizen LG TVs run webOS. Sony uses Android TV Amazon’s popular Fire TV devices run their own version of Android with a separate store and support. Roku has its own platform the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 each demand custom apps. And Apple commands overwhelming developer interest and attention and has repurposed iOS into tvOS for the new Apple TV.This is an all-out smart TV platform war, and a lot of people are going to suffer through a lot of badly-ported and hastily designed apps before it’s all over.When Netflix and Hulu update their Mobile apps, they’re also updating the P-Series experienceBut by dropping any desire to put apps on the TV itself, Vizio completely sidesteps the platform war entirely. Every app in the Android and the iOS app stores that supports Google Cast is a P-Series app. And iOS and Android apps are the apps developers care about most, so they’re often the best apps from a given service.That means when Netflix and Hulu update their Android and iOS apps, they’re also updating the P-Series experience. Vizio doesn’t need to beg HBO and ESPN to support its TVs anymore, because they already support Google Cast — and thus the P-Series. There’s no NFL Sunday Ticket app for the Apple TV, but the iOS and Android apps support Cast, so P-Series owners can pay to stream football.And if a new app comes out that doesn’t support Cast, Vizio has Google and millions of Chromecast owners to help make its case. "Our goal is that every app is available on every Google Cast device," says Queiroz."From an actual engineering perspective, this TV is actually as complex and smart, if not more so, than any TV we’ve ever made," says McRae. "We’ve just made it seem extraordinarily simple."            Prototypes of Vizio's SmartCast tablet remote and wireless charging dockVizio isn’t totally crazy. The P-series will still accept the same IR remote commands as any other Vizio TV for power, input selection, and volume, and it even comes with a small standard remote in the box to control those settings. If you already have a Vizio TV and generally use a cable box or universal remote, you can swap a new P-series TV into your setup and perhaps never know the difference, apart from the upgraded picture quality.But McRae says testing reveals that most people only use the standard remote out of habit for a few days — then they switch to the tablet entirely. "The pace of people moving to the tablet was faster than I would have told you before we got hundreds of these things in the field," he says. "It was quicker than I think any of us had expected."Vizio’s designers didn’t want the tablet wandering around the houseIf all remotes have one thing in common, it’s that they inevitably get lost. But Vizio’s designers didn’t want the tablet wandering around the house like any other device. "We fumbled around with a few different ways of creating a home for the tablet," says Vizio design chief Scott McManigal. "It really needed to have a connection to the TV." The work centered around rethinking what Vizio calls the "ceremonies" of using a television. "This is something that should have a ceremonial home in the living room," says McRae. "All those little ceremonies became really important."Ultimately, the company had what McRae calls an "aha" moment in the P-Series design process: a wireless charging dock that uses magnets to pull the tablet down into alignment with a satisfying tug. The dock also holds the tablet upright so it can display notifications from across the room. If you have the SmartCast app open when you put it on the dock, it’ll automatically return to the main control screen when you pull it off.In testing, the team found that although the tablet has enough battery capacity for 14 days of standby, the dock led people to grab the tablet when they wanted to start using the TV and replace it when they were done — a new ceremony.The team also decided to omit a TV power button from the tablet, a subtle, but calculated decision. With a standard TV, you walk into the room, grab the remote, and hit power to begin browsing for something to watch. But the Vizio team wanted to keep navigation focused on the tablet.            "If we had a hardware power button for the TV, we would have done something relatively stupid, because we were actually forcing an old ceremony on a new use case," says McRae. "We went through hundreds of these things.""We don’t have a separate team building our tablets, and then a separate team building our TVs," he adds, in obvious reference to Samsung. "The tablet and TV were designed in a single room, by a single team. That’s the only way you could do it.""They have to go together," says McManigal. "They’re very paired to be a premium experience.""The tablet and TV were designed in a single room, by a single team."Early prototypes of the tablet also featured more customization of Android, but McManigal and his team decided against it. "Our initial assumption was that you’d want to have all the remote control buttons on the home screen," he says. "But it just became very cluttered and very difficult to determine exactly which buttons you’d need."Instead, the tablet remote features stock Android, which means Vizio can update it faster. It also means that the SmartCast app can work in mostly the same way on every other Android device — it doesn’t rely on any custom features to show notifications or place playback controls in the notification shade.The tablet also lacks an IR blaster — it’s not a universal remote, and can’t control anything else in your home theater rack just yet. But Vizio also happens to be the leading vendor of soundbars in America, and it’s already showing off Cast-enabled soundbars and speakers. They’ll come out later in the year, completing the ecosystem. "Audio products with tiny little IR remotes are just horrible," says McRae. "Exporting the navigation element out to a screen that you’re familiar with changes how you interact. We’re really excited about opening a new wave of interaction with the devices in your house."            TVs have historically been very, very dumb, and they’re still among the dumbest gadgets in the home — for many people, they’re just displays for smarter devices. Making them smart brings with it the same tradeoff as in the other smart devices in our lives: data collection can dramatically improve consumer experiences, but at the expense of privacy.Vizio has stumbled into a couple privacy-related controversies in the past year: a class action lawsuit alleges that the company is collecting personal information on its customers. Meanwhile, the company’s IPO filing revealed plans for a ratings service designed to compete with Nielsen by anonymously collecting over 100 billion data points a day from internet-connected Vizio televisions. McRae says the lawsuit is "based on speculation" and that Vizio will "vigorously defend itself," but the ratings plans continue, and the technology is built into the P-Series.The P-Series blurs the lines between television and mobile devices"We collect data on an anonymous and aggregate level — there’s no personal information collected at all. It’s ratings," says McRae. "We’re using it to make the product better, and we’re using it to improve user experiences. We believe that next-generation user experiences will benefit greatly from recommendations — knowing that people who like football also like to watch Seinfeld. If a consumer feels uncomfortable with that, we want them to opt-out, and we’re happy if they opt-out."But new P-Series further blurs the lines between television and mobile devices. Mobile devices are built on tracking: both Apple and Google collect anonymous usage and diagnostic data from their phones unless you opt-out, and virtually every major mobile app contains analytics tracking code as well. Bringing television this far into the mobile era raises a new set of questions about what we’re comfortable having tracked.McRae doesn’t seem worried. "[SmartCast] makes it a lot easier to actually communicate with end users and ask whether they want to opt-in or out. Moving navigation to a tablet is actually good at that. We want to make sure consumers are always comfortable interacting with the Vizio brand. We’re trying to be as privacy-compliant and transparent as possible."            TVs are unwieldy things that tend to get hung on a wall and stay there for a while — they don’t get upgraded nearly as often as cellphones, tablets, and laptops. The displays might still look fine after a few years, but the processors quickly fall behind the curve and things get even slower and more irritating to use. Samsung has offered modular processor upgrades to combat this problem Apple has stayed out of the TV hardware market in part because of it.But the new P-Series doesn’t have any high-end processing in it — it just needs enough horsepower to decode and play a 4K HDR video stream over Google Cast. "Look, the octo-core processor shouldn’t be in the TV, it should be in the tablet you’re holding," says McRae. "You may buy a new phone a year from now that has even more horsepower. Guess what? You’ll be able to play a new class of games and streaming that up to our television without having to buy a new TV."Has Vizio invented its last TV?Considering the bleeding-edge 4K HDR display in the P-Series, that seems like it could make the upgrade cycle even longer. I ask McRae if Vizio has just invented its last TV."We don’t worry about device life cycle," he says, very seriously. "Our job is to build the best product we can build and have it last and be relevant to you for as long as possible."The P-Series represents a simple-seeming but incredibly bold bet on what consumers find relevant in a television — a bet that the only thing worth displaying on a TV screen is content, not navigation. It’s a bet that people, especially younger people who’ve never had cable, will want to buy a TV that’s actually just a second screen for their phones. &ampnbspAnd it’s a bet that Vizio can keep coming up with new ways to convince you to upgrade your TV."Every time we build the TV that will end all TVs, especially when it comes to picture quality, there are new boundaries we can push," says McRae. "We’ve got at least another three to five years of continuing to push the envelope on color and dynamic range. We feel very confident that we will be able to come up with more reasons for you to buy a television."* *Design by James BarehamEdited by Michael Zelenko
      Smartphones are connected computers that fit in our pockets — at this point, the "phone" part of them is virtually an afterthought. We use them for all kinds of communication that has nothing to do with a phone number: email, instant messaging, social networks, video calling, the list goes on. But if you want a smartphone, you have to pay for a voice calling plan. Often a text messaging plan is bundled or required as well. This goes for every major carrier, and even progressive Wi-Fi-first options such as Google’s Project Fi and Republic Wireless.Charge Mobile Data, a new service launching today, is offering something different: a data-only plan that doesn’t require the purchase of voice calling or text messaging. Charge, an MVNO that uses Sprint’s LTE network, will sell you a SIM card and data allotment that will work in any compatible phone or tablet. You won’t be able to make phone calls or send traditional SMS text messages with Charge, but you can use the data as you see fit, whether that’s for VOIP calling, video calling, messaging, tethering, or any other task that requires a data connection.Charge works with any Sprint-compatible device"We came up with the idea [for Charge] when we realized that we never used our voice calling plans, but weren’t able to get a smartphone without a voice plan from any carrier," says Andrew Benton, cofounder and CEO. The resulting service is very similar to&ampnbspKarma, but instead of tying the connection and data package to a mobile hotspot device, it’s paired to a SIM card that can go in any device you want, so long as that  device is compatible with Sprint’s LTE network. Benton says that the service will work with any Sprint-branded LTE device, as well as most modern Apple and Google Nexus devices, regardless of which carrier they were used on previously. You can expect it to work with CDMA versions of the iPhone 5S and 5C all versions of the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus all iPads starting with the iPad Air 2 and mini 3 and CDMA versions of the iPad mini 2. The company says it is working to add support for GSM devices in the future.I’ve been testing Charge Mobile Data for the past couple of weeks in a Nexus 5X and an iPad Pro — both unlocked devices that are compatible with Sprint. Using it with the iPad is just like using any other data service with an iPad: put in the SIM, turn it on, and get connected wherever you have a signal. The concept carries over to the Nexus 5X, as well, though the phone and text messaging apps obviously no longer function. Coverage with both devices was comparable to other Sprint devices I’ve used in the past.Charge’s rates for data are comparable to other pay-as-you-go services: pricing starts at $15 per gigabyte and drops to $13 per gigabyte when three or more are purchased at a time. A limited-time promotion offers a free gigabyte of data when five or more are purchased. There are no contracts or term commitments, and the purchased data never expires, much like Karma’s pay-as-you-go service.The service pairs nicely with LTE tabletsCharge might appeal to you if you have an older, unused phone lying around that you want to turn into a data-only device (it works just fine with 2013’s Nexus 5, for example), or if you want an LTE-connected tablet but aren’t interested in paying a monthly fee for it. If you’re savvy enough, you could pair Charge with a service like Google Voice and still retain the benefits of having a phone number, without having to pay for a voice plan.Either way, Charge’s data-only plan points to a future where we won’t have to pay for cellphone services we no longer use, while putting a greater emphasis on the services that we are using. Hopefully, this becomes a trend, and other carriers follow Charge’s lead, letting us begin the long goodbye to the phone number.
      When Starry announced its new venture for gigabit mesh networks in January, it was hailed as ambitious, innovative, and more than a little far-fetched. But Starry isn't the only company developing the technology. Patent records obtained by The Verge show that Facebook is actively developing an extremely similar technology.&ampnbspOne patent — filed by Facebook employee Sanjai Kohli in October but made public the week after the Starry announcement — describes a "Next Generation Data Network" that would connect computers using millimeter-wave radio links deployed as a mesh network. Both mesh and millimeter-wave technology are also central ideas in Starry's scheme.Another patent granted to Kohli at the end of 2015 describes the Next Generation Network in more detail, as a kind of centralized, cloud-based routing system. "The system dynamically adjusts route and frequency channel assignments, transmit power, modulation, coding, and symbol rate to maximize network capacity and probability of packet delivery, rather than trying to maximize the capacity of any one link," the patent reads. "This work is part of the Connectivity Lab."Reached by The Verge, Facebook confirmed the millimeter-wave research, and said its development was part of Internet.org's ongoing efforts to build out internet access for rural and poor populations. "This work is part of the Connectivity Lab which supports the mission of Internet.org — to connect the four billion people who don't have Internet access," a representative said. The Connectivity Lab is working on a number of such projects, including systems that would provide connections through satellites or drone-mounted lasers.As with most patents, there's no guarantee Facebook's millimeter-wave system will ever be built, but it lends new credibility to Starry's claims that millimeter-wave radio can revolutionize the way we connect to the web. It also suggests a possible conflict between the two companies, as both lay claim to ideas that appear to have been developed at more or less the same time. With Facebook's initial millimeter-wave patent yet to be granted, it's still unclear who would have the upper hand in such a fight.
      Creative Control,&ampnbspa sharp, dark send-up of present-day tech culture, made a big splash when it debuted at SXSW last year. Now, with a release both in theaters and online due some time in the coming months, Amazon has provided The Verge with&ampnbspa brand new trailer to get audiences excited about what's to come.The film, directed by Benjamin Dickinson, explores the life-changing aspects of a new pair of AR glasses called Augmenta. The glasses, in the words of one hyper-hip executive, aim to put "a magical layer" on top of reality. That magical layer serves, inevitably, to alienate the protagonist from the rest of his life. Creative Control shows his experience for the nightmare that it is, and the fact that the film is shot in black and white only accentuates the anxiety that comes with embracing this new technology.Creative Control will hit theaters later this year thanks to AmazonCreative Control earned heaps of praise at SXSW, going on to win the special jury prize for visual excellence at the festival. The acclaim eventually attracted Amazon, which&ampnbspbought the rights to the film late last year. Amazon, for its part, has been on a tear recently, as it snaps up more films from festivals and notable directors to better compete with Netflix. Just recently, it&ampnbspbought the American rights to Complete Unknown, a romantic drama that just debuted at Sundance. And with Spike Lee's Chi-raq due to launch on Amazon Prime this week, there are suddenly more reasons than ever to pay for a Prime account.            
      Microsoft is&ampnbspbringing its Windows Phone keyboard to iOS. The software giant is currently testing an early version of the keyboard internally, and will make it available to public testers soon. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans have revealed to The Verge that the iOS keyboard includes a special one-handed mode.While the Windows 10 Mobile keyboard also has a one-handed mode, Microsoft's iOS version is different. The one-handed mode works on each side, allowing you to use either hand to swipe letters or type on the go. Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile keyboard simply shifts to the side to create a compact keyboard, instead of the fanned key layout used in the iOS version.             Other than the one-handed mode, the rest of Word Flow for iOS is very similar to the Windows Phone version. You can access word suggestions, emoji, and swipe letters (like Swype) to type out words. Microsoft is planning to bring Word Flow to iOS in the coming months, with an Android version expected later this year.This is my next: The best keyboards for Android and iPhoneBe sure to subscribe to The Verge's YouTube channel for more videos
      T-Pain is bent over an iPad, dancing and tapping the screen to send glimmering electronic beats through huge speakers and out into the hallway of his home. We’re down in T-Pain’s basement studio, in a room filled with giant control boards, cases of equipment, and everything you’d need to put together a radio hit. But the only studio equipment T-Pain is using is his speakers — all the better to blast out the music he’s putting together in GarageBand.T-Pain works with Apple to promote GarageBand, and I'm here at his house, just outside Atlanta, Georgia, to see what he can do with the app’s latest iteration. He’s been playing around with an update to GarageBand for the past week that few other people have access to. The new iPad version adds an interface called Live Loops. It’s basically GarageBand's take on a MIDI controller, and it should make getting started with music creation much easier.   Speaking with T-Pain is kind of surreal. Though you'd know his Auto-Tuned voice anywhere on the radio, you might not know his actual voice: it's bright and jovial he's quick to laugh at a joke and bounces around from talking craft to making Game of Thrones references and discussing new tech he's interested in. He’s filled the lower level of his house with arcade games, colorful skateboard decks, and blown-up magazine covers with his face on them. Even his studio is playfully decorated, with bright red walls and light fixtures shaped like microphones dangling above your head.  It’s in here that T-Pain's been using Live Loops to put together a new song on the fly. He has the app opened up to its new interface — a big grid of squares, where each square represents a musical loop. Tap a square, and a loop starts to play. T-Pain is carefully timing out when he introduces each new sound, but since the app is largely for beginners, each loop can be set to automatically sync up with every other loop that's still playing. Get a few going at once, and you've basically got a song.T-Pain was using GarageBand long before Apple reached out to him. He says he's been using the app for years as a way to quickly put together new beats. Over a decade ago, outside clubs in Tallahassee, he'd use the app to make songs for people on the fly. Since then, he's used GarageBand while making Rappa Ternt Sanga, his debut album, as well as songs here and there throughout his more recent albums. "If I tell you that the last song I released was completely done GarageBand," he says, "you either wouldn’t believe it or you’d go, ‘I need to check out GarageBand.'"You can very quickly make something fun (but not necessarily something good)That sort of heavy professional usage isn't necessarily what this new interface is for. At first glance, at least, it seems more for people like me, who don't know the first thing about putting together a song. Because you're working with loops, rather than clips that play straight through, you can easily play around and put together something fun. But note that "fun" is very different from "good" — T-Pain didn't seem interested when I mentioned the Jazz/Club beat I've been working on, and my girlfriend, who's heard the track, describes it as "nonsense." Still, Apple is likely hoping that a lot of kids will make their first songs this way. Of course, the persistent criticism of GarageBand is that, while it may be good for getting started, it's still too limited to be used by serious artists. Eventually, they have to move on to programs like Logic (which is also made by Apple), Ableton Live, or Avid's Pro Tools. Pitchfork has a great feature on GarageBand from last year that included several musicians describing their early experiences with the app as empowering, before ultimately saying that they had to move on to something more flexible. Many artists seem embarrassed to be associated with GarageBand, since it's seen as a tool for amateurs. Grimes, for instance, has gone out of her way to dispel the myth that she relies on GarageBand. (She used it on her breakout album, 2012's Visions, but she's since switched primarily to Ableton.)T-Pain laughs off the criticism when I ask him about it. "That’s weird," he says. "It’s totally legitimate." GarageBand has become a lot more capable over time, he says, offering more granular control over sounds, the ability to manage more tracks, and — a new feature in this release — the use of third-party apps, like iMaschine, as additional instruments. It has nowhere near the power of Logic, but T-Pain says he sees Apple bringing more of Logic's features down to GarageBand, rather than stripping things out of GarageBand for further ease of use. That makes Garageband a useful tool for putting together ideas when he’s outside the studio.  "Usually when I open up GarageBand, I'm not in a place where I can start belting out lyrics and recording," he says, mentioning that he often uses the app while traveling. "I'm trying to get a solid production piece out of it. And that usually happens."  While T-Pain steps out to take a call, I strike up a conversation with his studio engineer, who's sitting behind a big display running Pro Tools mounted above a control board covered in hundreds of knobs. His assessment of GarageBand is largely the same as T-Pain's: the app, he says, is perfectly capable for assembling a track, even if it can't take a pro all the way to the final, polished product. "Pain and I always like to say, 'It's the carpenter, not the hammer.'"When T-Pain returns, we start to go through more of what GarageBand's Live Loops interface can do. He's bent over the iPad again, quickly creating a new loop by almost haphazardly tapping a few keys on the on-screen piano. What he creates is short and sparse — it doesn't sound like much, and I'm expecting him to delete it the second I leave. But then he starts to play the new loop over of a song he's been working on. "Here we go," he says. He scrubs ahead to part of the chorus and starts to play the loop again. It fits perfectly. "I'll probably end up using that right there." That quickly, his demo has gone from a square on a grid to a tiny piece of a work in progress."I actually have done something with this."GarageBand isn’t the only app out there trying to make music more accessible it isn’t even the only app using a gridded interface like Live Loops. But as a serviceable music creation tool that’s available for free to all iOS devices, it’s hard to ignore the greater role it can have in enabling music creation for people who otherwise wouldn’t know how to get started. It's expanding on that in other ways, too. GarageBand for the iPad is also getting a feature called Drummer, which can automatically add drums in several different styles, and Apple is releasing&ampnbspa brand new app for recording called Music Memos, which is meant to let people who play guitar or piano quickly capture their ideas.These aren't things that T-Pain needs he knows his way around far more complicated tools. But if you take his word for it, GarageBand still manages to make creating music easier for him. And Live Loops is Apple's attempt to start doing that for everyone else.Before leaving, I press T-Pain one final time on whether he could actually see himself using GarageBand’s new interface to make a final song. "I actually have done something with this," he says, grinning at me. "You'll recognize it."Video by Max Jeffrey and Phil Esposito.

      Much to the disappointment of space nerds everywhere, man has not stepped foot on the Moon in more than 40 years. Governments have sent expensive robots and satellites to our nearest celestial neighbor, but the Moon remains woefully under-explored.That's why Google and the X Prize foundation teamed up to offer $30 million to the first private enterprise that can soft-land a robot on the surface of the Moon and have it traverse 500 meters of the lunar surface.A number of teams are competing, but only one, the Part Time Scientists team from Germany, has the backing of automotive giant Audi — and a working prototype of the team's moon rover is debuting at Audi's booth at the Detroit Auto Show. I got an exclusive sneak peek and trust me: it's out of this world. The Moon has fascinated man for millennia. Its eclipses have terrified unknowing tribes, while its gravitational pull creates the tides. And yet, for all that we know, there is so much more that we have yet to discover.It's that sense of scientific wonder — exploration for the sake of exploration — that the PT Scientists team wants to pursue. It also drove the team to choose the landing site of the Apollo 17 mission, the only Apollo landing mission with a scientist aboard, for its X Prize quest.And Audi is giving them prime time space, including a spot in the Audi booth at the Detroit Auto Show. The Audi Lunar Quattro is a functional prototype, able to drive around on the show floor. It's rather cute, in a Wall-E sort of way, and it makes you want to root for this small team from Germany. Even with the backing of Audi, it's a tall order to get to the Moon. Space, as they say, is hard.THIS IS THE DROID AUDI WAS LOOKING FORBut to help them get there, Audi has helped perfect the 3D printing process to create nearly the entire rover out of aluminum and titanium. It uses special channels to route wiring inside hollow structural components, something that couldn't be done with a CNC process. "It's not possible from the axis of freedom," says Robert Böhme, CEO of PT Scientists. "The parts are like 1 millimeter thick."3D printing isn't just going to contribute to the building of the rover. The team wants to create a 3D printer that can use lunar soil already chock full of aluminum, titanium, and magnesium to eventually create parts for other devices on the Moon. The theory is that it's a lot easier to build something new on the Moon than it is to ship it there.Another idea is to literally melt the lunar surface to create a kind of "autobahn" for lunar robots, allowing them to move around predetermined routes at higher speeds than would be normally available in the ultra-fine lunar surface. These are for future missions, but it shows how far the PT Scientists team is thinking.And Audi too. This is one area where Böhme is especially excited. "Can you name any other case where such a large [non-aerospace] company decided to say 'we want to get involved in private space'?" The hope is to get other large companies without traditional aerospace ambitions involved, especially where their expertise could be useful. "If you bring the right technology back to the Moon, you can pave the way for more exploration," says Böhme. "And not just exploration, but also to find a commercial benefit for future missions. It's really hard to justify a lunar mission now, even if you get it down to $30 million."It's important to show what can be done"That's why we want to focus so much on science, we want to show that there is the value. There is value that you can take away from being on the surface of the Moon. It's important to show what could be done."The ultimate objective is to travel to the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) left behind by Apollo 17 some 43 years ago. NASA asks any visitors to the Moon not to land too close to the sensitive (and historic) moon landing sites, but the PT Scientists rover could land nearby and travel to the LRV. The idea is to see just how well it's held up being exposed to the lunar elements for all these years. The temperature on that part of the Moon can swing hundreds of degrees centigrade between the night and day cycles, and that can do a number on the aluminum, titanium, and plastic components of the LRV."You can get a great deal of knowledge from materials science to learn what works and what doesn't," says Böhme. "Long-term exposure, what materials can you use?"Böhme says his team didn't even set out to win the X Prize. That's just a nice bonus. The goal is to reach the LRV, which would require a journey of 2.3 kilometers from the planned landing site, almost five times the distance required to win the $30 million bounty.And that's the main reason why PT Scientists needed sponsorship from Audi. The $30 million launch budget is a rounding error for Audi's R&ampampD department (even with the diesel scandal hanging around). The team has already won a few milestone awards from the X Prize organization."I want to have a benefit for everybody.""What's really important for me is to not just do it because of the X Prize. I want to have a benefit for everybody," says Böhme. Landing and driving 500 meters "does not give mankind any value." Instead, he wants to explore the LRV and learn how to "live off the land" and create parts for future missions on the Moon. If we can learn how to 3D print items on the Moon, using lunar soil, it could open up an entire new world for exploration. That could allow future missions to simply include replication units to print whatever you need.The goal is to launch a pair of rovers to the Moon by the third quarter of 2017, some 18 months from now. And, of course, to win the X Prize.Still, Böhme gives credit to NASA's Apollo program for showing everyone that it could be done: "Without Apollo, all of this wouldn't be possible."
      Microsoft just released Cortana for iOS and Android this week, but it's planning much bigger features for its future Windows integration. Cortana first arrived on Windows 10 earlier this year, and now Microsoft is planning and building major updates, codenamed Redstone, to the operating system that will make Cortana a lot more powerful. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge that the company is experimenting with having Cortana float around Windows 10. A floating CortanaThis floating mechanism would allow Cortana to appear on top of documents, contextually, and provide information and assistance. We're told it's more of a powerful search tool, than an annoying animated character like Clippy. If Microsoft pushes ahead with its Cortana plans then the digital assistant will be able to control even more Windows features, like the ability to mute all incoming notifications quickly.Microsoft is also considering further integrating its Office 365 services directly into Cortana so they're available straight within Windows 10. For businesses this could mean Windows 10 can serve as a hub for projects, with the ability for Cortana to understand who's working on a document and surface useful information.Cortana won't be the only area of focus for Microsoft's Redstone work. We understand that Microsoft wants the Windows 10 notification center (known as Action Center) to be a lot more functional than it is today. Future versions will likely allow apps to integrate widget-like functionality.             On the phone side, Microsoft is currently developing an on-tap service for Cortana. Similar to Google Now's feature, Cortana will appear contextually to enable quick access to information or additional search queries. Microsoft has already been testing this feature with the&ampnbspBing snapshots on tap app for Android.Cortana on tap for Windows 10 MobileMicrosoft's Cortana ambitions for Redstone also include the idea of resuming activities and data across multiple devices and platforms. Cortana is now available on iOS and Android, and Microsoft has enabled a feature on the Android app that lets you reply to missed calls with a text message from a Windows 10 PC. Microsoft calls this "task continuation," and it's a core part of the thinking behind how Cortana will progress in the next major updates to Windows 10.Microsoft is close to previewing some of its Windows 10 updates, including&ampnbspextensions support for its Edge browser. Most of Microsoft's Redstone work is in the early stages or still being planned, so expect to hear a lot more about the future of Windows 10 early next year.
      Inside a suburban Los Angeles industrial building that once served as an R&ampampD facility for Japanese automotive giant Nissan, natural midday light spills through the windows. Today, a very different company occupies this space. I arrive at lunchtime. It's catered, in true startup fashion — there’s no time to have your employees actually leaving the building for lunch, of course. By 1 o’clock, the cafeteria cleared out there isn't much time for kicking back, even on a Friday afternoon.This is the headquarters of Faraday Future, a young, seemingly well-funded company with an odd name that hasn’t said much about what it’s working on. We know that electric cars are involved, and we know that they’re probably years away from production. In the year and a half since Faraday’s founding, it has transformed this facility into a bustling corporate campus, stacked with a who’s-who list of poaches from some of California’s most prominent tech companies.Tesla is one of those companies. For the past decade, Tesla has made the cars of the future: sleekly designed, technically advanced machines that brought with them a vision of how amazing and practical electric cars could be. Tesla, despite its problems and lack of profitability, has disrupted the auto industry by forcing it to think bigger. But now trading as a public company, Tesla is no longer the feisty new kid on the block — and it could be ripe for disruption, if Faraday gets its way.              Nick Sampson, head of Faraday Future's engineering and R&ampampD. Faraday Future first came into the news last summer when news leaked of its existence and its intention to produce electric cars. But speculation swirled around the company’s origins, its finances, and exactly what kind of car it was intending to build. In recent weeks, intrigue has heightened, as news has trickled about its links to Chinese investors and the identity of its unnamed CEO.This week, Faraday Future chief designer Richard Kim is expected to announce that the company will participate at CES in January, its first major trade show. Though Faraday is still very much in stealth mode, it recently announced that it plans to spend $1 billion on a US factory that will produce electric cars using a non-traditional sales model — possibly where owners would temporarily "subscribe" to different vehicles depending on their needs. While a prototype might be introduced soon, mass manufacturing could still be years away. Making cars isn’t easy Google, for instance, farms out the production of its self-driving prototypes to a third party.In Faraday’s engineering facility, the floors are a spotless white with sundry car parts and brightly colored machines tucked in corners.  A large 3D printer sits on a table. Engineers are hunched over terminals. During my visit, conversation among the employees was the only audible sound. The work of developing modern electric cars is quiet, it turns out.The brief history of Faraday recalls Tesla’s early yearsIt’s probably no coincidence that the brief history of Faraday recalls Tesla’s early years. When Tesla was founded in 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, Elon Musk was an investor in the background. Later, when Musk took the reins as chairman and eventually CEO, he doggedly guided it to manufacture the Roadster, largely through sheer force of will. In doing so, Tesla turned to the auto industry to mine for talent and attracted employees from its production partner, Lotus. Now, Faraday has attracted a fair number of former Tesla staff to join as senior managers and throughout the ranks of the company.One of those executives is Nick Sampson, a senior VP at Faraday in charge of R&ampampD and engineering. He also acts as the company’s public face. Sampson is a tall, lean man, with a  London accent and flushed cheeks who began his career at Jaguar in the late 1970s, moved on to worked as a race technician in the British Touring Car Championship, and later served as chief engineer and program director at Lotus. In 2010, he joined Tesla, where he served as the director of vehicle and chassis engineering for two years. He last worked at a Trexa, a company that builds electric vehicle platforms.Sampson says Faraday was born from a conversation. "Three people sitting around in an office, discussing the future of the car and what people’s mobility would be in the future. Eighteen months later, we’ve got over 400 people working from all over the world," he says. He expects that number to double within the next year.              The Tesla comparisons are easy and obvious — a Southern California startup with aims on upending the auto business — but Faraday doesn’t want to be seen as a mere Tesla clone. "We’re creating an environment that’s even more creative, even more innovative for people," he says. "Many people look at Tesla and think they’ve done it differently than the traditional auto industry — and they have. But there’s other ways and other things we can capitalize on."First off, Faraday sought expertise from beyond the auto business.  "We reached out into the aerospace industries, the medical device industries, into the internet and technology industries to pull together a group of people with a diverse range of skills that could build a product that’s new and different," he says. In addition to Tesla, BMW, and Audi, the new hires come from Apple, SpaceX, and Hulu."The car should begin to learn my desires."But I still wasn’t exactly sure what "the Faraday future" was, and this company — this secretive, well-funded institution with ambiguous goals — has done little to answer questions in the year and a half since its founding. In describing Faraday’s goals to me, Sampson’s first reference point was the desire to see more connectivity in cars. "As soon as you get in your car, you lose that level of connectivity. Today’s cars aren’t meeting the needs of today’s people, let alone generations yet to come. The kids of tomorrow will be wanting to be connected all the time.""If I plan my journey, the car should know my journey and some of the places I want to visit along the way, because it knows my preferences," he continued. "The car should begin to learn my desires, and not just me as owner or user, but the people who are with me. It should be a much more social event to be in the car, to interact with people inside and outside the car."Beyond that, though, details are scant. Faraday’s cars will be electric, and Sampson suggested that they will be autonomous. More pointedly, he focused on the potential for new ownership models that Faraday is considering. "Uber, for instance, is a new way of traveling, a new way of getting about. Some people are considering not even having a car. The cars of the future have got to meet those needs," he says. Sampson imagines various custom vehicles that are designed for specific purposes such as a family trip, the work commute, or Home Depot runs. "I don’t have to buy one compromise vehicle, I can just have use of the perfect model when I need it, like a subscription service. We now subscribe to music we used to buy music."             Faraday Future design chief Richard Kim stands inside the company's Gardena, California headquarters. For now, Faraday might not be quite ready to reveal its strategy — but it can’t sit still, and it certainly has no first-mover advantage. It joins a large and growing race to redefine modern mobility that is spreading across both the auto and technology industries."I think of them as like-minded allies," he says, thinking of legacy automakers and new players like Google. But Faraday is intent on making its own real, sellable car. They’ve floated 2017 as the target goal, which seems unrealistically aggressive for a company of its age when I asked Sampson if they would have a car on the road by 2020, his answer was a definitive "absolutely." At the furious rate they seem to be working and growing, it feels plausible that a show car could appear sooner. "We already have a test vehicle running, testing the electrical system, the battery, powertrain. We’re well through the design process for production. We’re already releasing data and information to start having parts made for real vehicles in the future.""The car is still going to be beautiful, as traditional car designers want to have."Later, I met up with Kim, Faraday’s design chief, who greeted me standing next to a covered prototype. As part of our arrangement, I agreed to keep my impressions on its exterior silhouette out of my report — but its shape was distinct from anything I’ve seen on the road. "It’s a car to some degree," Kim tells me, who was previously responsible for designing BMW’s electrified i3 and i8 models. "It’s a mobility device, and when people interact with cars, there is of course the irrational desire to have it. The car is still going to be beautiful, as traditional car designers want to have."We moved on to the design studio on the top floor, where jazzy house music played in the background. Some 65 designers and support staff report to Kim, and on the day of my visit, the team buzzed with excitement about the work being done. In addition to traditional automotive CAD modeling, the designers work with Oculus Rift and augmented reality.Kim said he and his team made up the process for designing with new technology on the fly in order to meet their tight design deadlines. "We’re doing things super fast in a third of the time that I am used to," says Kim. We’re still doing it high-quality and it’s giving new insight to see things immediately," he says. "We’re using the technology as it’s being developed. You see designers with a VR headset and they are pointing in space." Everyone I spoke to at the company said they feel a sense of freedom to do things that they couldn’t do at other companies, which clearly is helping to motivate them — even on that late Friday afternoon, the designers seemed focused. They’d better for now, Faraday still doesn’t have a product, and the financial mathematics of the car business are brutal. Just ask Elon Musk.
      Occipital, the maker of the Structure Sensor, has acquired a company called Lynx Laboratories, one that launched its own mobile 3D scanner on Kickstarter a few years ago. The Lynx staff will join Occipital at its headquarters in Boulder, Colorado. But more importantly, Occipital now has access to algorithms developed by Lynx that make 3D depth mapping far more accurate than ever before — algorithms that will make the Structure Sensor even better.Lynx's IP won't increase the resolution of the Structure Sensor, but it cuts back on the sensor mapping errors by up to 90 percent. Occipital says that initial tests reduced the error of its 3D depth maps from 5 inches down to 1/4 inch. "It’s a big deal for the idea of mapping your entire home," says Jeff Powers, Occipital's CEO. "Usually we're limited to an object, or an artifact, or a person. But this tech really lets us blow that out to something like a room."The new tech will actually roll out to Structure Sensor owners as an update at some point in early 2016, probably not long after the company shows off the new capabilities at CES.The increased performance will be a big deal, but anyone who's had one of these devices for a while is probably used to seeing it get better with age. "From the first time somebody had a Structure Sensor to what we can do with it now is just — you wouldn't think it's the same device," Powers says. "When we launched the structure sensor and people first received units they couldn't even capture things in color."The Structure Sensor is the go-to product for easy 3D scanningAs months went by, things like color support and HD texturing were added, making the device more and more capable with time thanks to carefully constructed software updates. "With computer vision it's as much about the algorithms as it is about the inputs," Powers says.The Structure Sensor isn't the kind of thing that you see every single day, but in situations where someone needs a 3D scan it's usually the go-to product. I had my head scanned by one at a 3D-printing festival earlier this year, and during a recent trip to the Museum of Natural History I saw it being used by a college professor to 3D-map dinosaur skeletons. If you watch closely, you can even see it being used during our look inside Industrial Light and Magic's secret Star Wars VR lab.new pym.Parent('theverge-structure-sensor-before-and-after__graphic', '//apps.voxmedia.com/at/theverge-structure-sensor-before-and-after/', {xdomain: '.*\.voxmedia\.com'})A scan of stairs done without (left) and with (right) the new, more accurate tech.Eventually, 3D scanning could (and probably will) be a touted feature on your phone just like the camera or the voice assistant. This new tech from Lynx could help inspire that to happen even sooner, but for now, it helps Occipital distance itself from all that impending competition. Powers also says that it gives them a little more breathing room until the company needs to release new hardware.The more immediate impact might be seen in virtual or augmented reality. After all, mapping a user's movements and their surroundings is hard, and is something we've seen universities dedicate entire rooms (and budgets) to. "I think building it into smartphones is obviously going to be huge, but also building it into wearable devices is really going to be interesting, like VR and AR headsets," Powers says. "But it's hard to say which will happen first."
      Pornhub, one of the world's largest adult entertainment sites, has introduced a new feature that it hopes will make it easier for people to identify revenge porn and request its removal. In a press release published today, the site announced a&ampnbspnew online submission form (NSFW)&ampnbspthat revenge porn victims can use to flag any explicit videos or images that were published without their consent. Previously, revenge porn takedown requests could only be filed through email.Pornhub, which sees around 60 million visitors a day, declined to disclose the volume of revenge-porn related requests it receives, though it says complaints have fallen by 38 percent over the past two years. It hopes that the new submission form will eliminate some of the "red tape" that victims had to cut through previously, and that it will be enough of a deterrent to reduce nonconsensual content on its platform. In its press release, the company described the new form as a "preemptive strike" against what's become a growing form of online harassment. "It is vital that we continue to make our community feel safe.""It is vital that we continue to make our community feel safe," Corey Price, Pornhub vice president, said in an email. "We want all Pornhub users to know that this new reporting process is for their security and peace of mind first and foremost."Most US states and some countries have implemented laws against revenge porn, which entails explicit photos and videos distributed without the consent of those depicted. The content is often posted by disgruntled exes, though it may also be stolen and distributed without the knowledge of those involved.Revenge porn laws have led to some convictions in the US and abroad, though it can be challenging for victims to force the removal of nonconsensual content. And once the offending materials are published online, it's notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to completely wipe them from the web.Web companies have broader abilities to police user-generated content, and several have implemented policies that forbid nonconsensual sexual material. Sites like Google, Reddit, and Microsoft have recently cracked down on revenge porn on their platforms, though most major adult websites have yet to take similar steps."To my knowledge, [Pornhub] is the first major adult site to take a public stand against nonconsensual pornography or to offer a streamlined process to report it," Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami and vice president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, said in an email. "This move by Pornhub would provide victims with a way to have their private material removed from one of the major pornography platforms, which is a significant help," she added.    Pornhub's new submission form is designed to streamline the reporting process for revenge porn victims.Instead of writing an email to explain the reasoning behind a takedown request, visitors to Pornhub can now file requests by filling in basic information on its online form, which is accessible through the site's support page. Users will be prompted to enter their name, email address, and the URL of the link they wish to remove. They will also be asked whether they ever agreed to the distribution of the content, and must submit a "digital signature" to verify their identity and the accuracy of their submission.From there, Pornhub will investigate the material and remove it accordingly, though the site declined to comment on the specific processes it uses to verify the authenticity of requests, citing concerns over abuse and fraudulent reports. Unlike other adult sites, Pornhub does not require users to submit government-issued photo ID with their takedown requests. The company says it implemented that policy as a way to protect the anonymity of victims, and not deter them from coming forward."Being a revenge porn victim is embarrassing enough as it is," Price says, "we would rather not make the reporting process equally awkward, or make people feel apprehensive about approaching us to begin with."David Bateman, a partner at the Pittsburgh-based law firm K&ampampL Gates, describes the concept behind Pornhub's initiative as "fabulous," saying that "the more that websites are willing to respect the rights of revenge porn victims the better off the world is going to be." But he notes that when it comes to policing illegal content, time is of the essence."The quicker you get them down, the more likely it is that they will disappear forever.""The quicker you get them down, the more likely it is that they will disappear forever," says Bateman, whose firm&ampnbsplaunched an initiative last year to provide legal support for revenge porn victims. "As a practical matter, time is very important because you really don't want people collecting them and republishing them. But once it goes viral like that, it's a nightmare for people. And there's no solution to that."Franks, who is working with US lawmakers on national revenge porn legislation, says that Pornhub's open condemnation of revenge porn "has the potential to shift social norms and expectations about sexual entertainment." But she says the site should disable the explicit banner ads on the bottom of its submission form, and believes adult sites could generally be more proactive in making sure that nonconsensual content never makes it to their platforms in the first place. The deterrents she suggests seem easy to implement: a clearly displayed reminder that revenge porn is illegal in most US states, or a simple checkbox for users to verify that the materials they upload are being distributed with the full consent of all parties."If Pornhub or any other site or platform featuring adult content really wants to launch a ‘preemptive strike' ... against nonconsensual pornography, they should be focusing on truly preemptive measures, not after-the-fact procedures," Franks said.
      As embarrassing as this is to admit, my first foray into art was through furries and anime. (I can’t believe I am putting this on the internet after thoroughly obliterating any trace of my middle school art from the web.) Fandom was seminal in the beginning stages of my art career I loved all of it and the fan art community was great at giving feedback. I slowly moved away from my “nerd” roots while studying art in school, and fashion, beauty, and film soon filled the space where manga and Harry Potter used to live. My senior thesis was 20 watercolor pieces of black women in high-fashion clothing and now I’m an editorial designer at Racked, Vox Media’s fashion site.     So I was particularly excited —&ampnbspand flattered and shocked — when an editor at Marvel contacted me to illustrate a cover. It was a return to my roots. He had seen the branding I had done for my friends who run&ampnbspBlack Girls Talking and wanted me to take a crack at illustrating for an upcoming title called Illuminati, which features three lesser-known supervillains Titania, The Hood, and Thunderball as the leads. It would fall under&ampnbspthe special variant series using hip-hop album covers as the inspiration.Imposter syndrome is something I often deal with, and even though the editor told me he had seen my work and wanted me anyways, there was something I could not shake. Marvel is known for its slick colors, its detailed compositions, its beefiness. My illustration practice was impressionistic, messy, colorful and feminine. Drawing beautiful woman and beautiful objects became my bread and butter during my final year of school my illustrations are an exercise in restraint.    However, after I got over the initial terror (and texting my mom to tell her the good news), I accepted. How many illustrators can say they’ve illustrated for Marvel?The editor reassured me that the assignment would be simple and play to my strengths (phew!). After asking for a couple more figure studies, he sent over character reference for the villains, which included past covers and character design sheets developed in-house, as well as the album art I would be recreating –&ampnbspIce-T’s Power. Titania, The Hood, and Thunderball are all super villains within the Marvel universe and some pretty heavy hitters, which makes them perfect for the Power cover. Titania is their strongest woman character, while The Hood is a crime boss, and Thunderball often goes head-to-head against Thor.Ice-T's 'Power' was controversial at the timePower’s cover stirred up a bit of controversy after the release — thanks to the pose, styling, and the shotgun held by Darlene Ortiz, Ice-T’s then-girlfriend. Honestly, she pulls all the weight here sexy but still able to hold her own. (I was secretly thanking the universe that I didn’t have to draw a background.)I had to take a very different approach to this piece than with my personal work. I usually deal in watercolors, but because I would be going through multiple rounds of revisions, digital was the way to go. I usually stray from Photoshop if it’s not for post-production because I feel that my most successful work has my hand in it. Digital can get a bit too slick – but it also has an Undo button. I decided to use some brushes from&ampnbspKyle Webster, an illustrator who not only creates work for big clients like Time, the New York Times and others, but has also garnered a huge following for his extremely realistic natural media Photoshop brushes. With these, I could try and capture the texture and effects from traditional media that I love but still be in control.The length of a letter sized piece of paper is usually a good measurement for a full figure. I always start super sketchy with simple shapes and then flesh out details later.    I scanned everything into Photoshop and threw down some simple color fields. When you’re illustrating for a client, it always helps to show them the type of colors you have in mind so they aren’t surprised by the final. There was also an extra step Legal had to look at each step of my progress to make sure I was staying true to the original creations.    I took a few liberties with the characters the first time around, due to seeing various interpretations during my research. My editor was enthusiastic but sent over some more relevant reference and notes — for example, Titania’s hair is always in a top bun, The Hood always wears a suit and Thunderball is so muscular, you would probably see his other arm from the angle the viewer is looking from.    At this stage, we were ready to move towards the final piece. New York Comic Con was fast approaching and they wanted to make sure they could debut it the first day — no pressure! Impressionistic is a nice word for calling my work messy, and I wanted to avoid as much of that as possible. I decided to trace over my original sketches using my glass dining room table as a lightbox. I am nothing if not resourceful.Comic Con was fast approachingTraditional inking is tedious, especially if you use a tiny brush like I do, but also can be relaxing and meditative. I was working on this cover after coming home from my day job of design and illustrating, often late into the night. In Photoshop, I painted each character separately to really focus on the detail of each. Playing with the balance between painting over the line art and leaving some of them intact, the figures slowly started to look like any other piece I would have done.        I set up my files like I would if I were doing a painting, placing blobs on the "canvas" to pull from as I worked. Working on one layer not only made it easier to keep things simple but it also made the layering of colors and textures believable painting is full of happy accidents — who’s to say digital can’t have the same?Returning to my rootsWork went like this for all of the characters. I saved them all out as separate .jpgs and dropped them in a new Photoshop file at Marvel’s print specifications. After agonizing over whether I was "worthy" or "qualified" to illustrate a Marvel cover, I really am proud with how it turned out. If someone believes in your work, you should too. And it felt great to get back to my roots in fandom it’s where I started and I feel like I came full circle. &lt!--new pym.Parent('theverge-marvel-illuminati-hip-hop-cover-slider__graphic', '//apps.voxmedia.com/at/theverge-marvel-illuminati-hip-hop-cover-slider/', {xdomain: '.*\.voxmedia\.com'})// --&gt 
      Verizon doesn't want to be the bad guy and completely get rid of its old unlimited data plans, so it's pursuing a new strategy: price customers out of them.&ampnbspThe Verge has learned that Verizon will soon raise the monthly cost of grandfathered unlimited data plans by an additional $20 per line to $49.99. A friendly tipster clued us in on the change, and when contacted for comment, a Verizon spokesperson confirmed the news. The new rate will apply beginning in November.To be clear, $49.99 is the cost of unlimited data alone and is added on top of your monthly voice and text plan. I've got the Nationwide Talk &ampamp Text 450 plan ($59.99), so this change would raise my monthly payment to $109.98, and that's before Verizon's extra fees and charges. If you've got more or unlimited voice minutes, you'll pay more each month. For customers determined to remain on the unlimited plan, Verizon will now let them purchase new smartphones through its monthly device payment plan previously, you could only buy phones outright at their full retail cost. That's one upside in this news. Verizon will let you pay for phones monthly and keep unlimited dataNote that this change only impacts customers who are out of contract if you're signed to an existing two-year agreement, you'll keep your current rate for the term of that contract. Once you go month-to-month, the $49.99 data fee takes effect. Verizon also says that government and corporate accounts won't be included in the price hike.Assuming they haven't done so already, the move will force many Verizon customers to weigh just how much unlimited data means to them — and what they're willing to pay to keep it. The carrier recently unveiled&ampnbspsimplified data packages (S/M/L/XL/XXL), and this decision is obviously meant to drive consumers onto those newer plans. And if you still refuse to relinquish unlimited data at this price, you're probably burning through a lot of data every month. Verizon knows that, and now the company is happy to make you pay more for such freedom. Verizon says less than one percent of its customer base is tied to unlimited data plans, so the numbers are dwindling.Only two of the four major US wireless carriers still offer unlimited data plans T-Mobile's costs $80 per month, and Sprint recently announced it'll be&ampnbspincreasing the cost of its unlimited option to $70. Verizon stopped selling unlimited data to new customers way back in 2011.Correction: I originally had the overall price of Verizon's unlimited data plan wrong. It was previously $29.99 before this increase, which makes the new rate $49.99. Sorry, I'm just no good at math in the mornings — or ever, really.
      For the first time, Facebook has collaborated with its Oculus division to bring a taste of virtual reality to the core product. Today the company is bringing 360-degree videos to the News Feed, a move that could introduce the format’s immersive short films and animations to their largest audience yet. The videos, which are debuting on Android and the web, allow you to change the field of view by tapping the screen or moving your phone in space. And they offer some tantalizing hints about how Facebook plans to evolve the News Feed into something more than two-dimensional. To start with, you’ll see videos from Star Wars, GoPro, VICE, LeBron James, The Discovery Channel, and Saturday Night Live, among others. VICE did an on-the-ground shoot in Afghanistan James’ video showcases his workouts. SNL partly filmed its recent 40th anniversary in 360-degree video, and is highlighting a clip that features Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake.&ampnbspAnyone can publish one of the videos starting today. (You won’t see any of them on iOS, though — at least, not yet.)On Tuesday, I visited Facebook’s campus to see how 360-degree videos look on Facebook. On the web, they’re just fine — you click around to shift your perspective it feels like using Google Maps’ Street View feature inside a video. But on mobile, the videos feel much more alive: using the phone’s gyroscope, Facebook tracks your relative position inside the video. This is a lot of fun with the Star Wars demo, which builds on footage from the recent trailer showing a landspeeder zooming across the desert. Spin in a circle, as I did a few times while watching the demo, and the desert spins right around with you.Spin and the desert spins right around with youFacebook is not the first big company to offer a home for 360-degree video. YouTube rolled out its version in March, and it works much the same as Facebook’s: tap a video, turn your phone sideways, and explore the content. (I particularly recommend doing this on YouTube if you have an iPhone and are curious what Facebook’s 360-degree videos look like. They look like that!) And YouTube isn’t alone: Kolor, a maker of 360-degree video software owned by GoPro, makes a player for desktops and mobile devices and hosts a public gallery for viewing the format in VR or on the phone.But in both of those cases, you would probably only see those videos if you first thought to search for them. Facebook’s News Feed is used by upwards of 1 billion people every month, representing 360-video’s best chance so far to reach a large audience and break through to the mainstream.Perhaps that’s why, as I meet with members of the Facebook team, they speak of 360-degree video with outsized enthusiasm. "There are certain things that, when you hold them in your hands for the first time, they attract a crowd," says Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer. "People come to tell you they just saw it, and you have to see it. There aren’t that many of those. This is one of them.""Over time we've seen the modes of sharing become more mobile, and more immersive."Will Cathcart, a director of product management, says the videos represent the next logical step for the News Feed. Text led to photos, which led to video, which led to autoplay video. "Over time we’ve seen the modes of sharing shift to become more mobile, and more immersive," he says. "Here what we’ve done is look at all the really cool 360-degree video content people are creating and think through, what’s the right way to bring that experience to News Feed."Though Facebook led the project, the team worked closely with its colleagues at Oculus, which is grappling with similar issues as it develops its virtual reality platform. "Facebook and Oculus are sharing," Cox says. "The team that’s working on this, the team that’s working on this stuff in VR, is very fluid in terms of the engineers, the product managers, the designers, sharing backgrounds and skill sets. It’s been a very positive collaboration." And are more collaborations coming? "We hope so," he says.&lt!--(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&ampversion=v2.3"  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'))// --&gtStar Wars: The Force Awakens Immersive 360 ExperienceSpeed across the Jakku desert from Star Wars: The Force Awakens with this immersive 360 experience created exclusively for Facebook.Posted by Star Wars on Wednesday, September 23, 2015That’s not to say the next step is a full-fledged virtual reality version of Facebook, though Cox has previously said the company is building VR versions of its apps. But when viewed on a headset like the Oculus Rift, these videos can at least approximate VR. And even when viewed on a phone or the web, 360-degree video is like VR in at least one way: both illustrate how products are evolving to let us share more of our experiences with one another, thanks to technology that is richer with information and uses more of our senses.If you’ve shot a 360-degree video — and please let’s come up with a nickname for these, I’m already tired of typing it — you can upload it to Facebook in standard formats. For now, most of your options for shooting in the format are expensive the Bublcam, one of the more affordable options, costs $800. But cheaper options are on the way Ricoh’s Theta S Digital Camera, which shoots what it calls "spherical panoramas," goes on sale October 23rd for $350.A slightly more virtual worldVR is evolving fast enough that you can already imagine the day 360-degree video will look clunky: a relic of a time when there wasn’t a VR headset in most homes, and we had to click around SNL clips in the browser with mice. In the meantime, though, a lot of people are about to get their first taste of a slightly more virtual world.
      One of the highlights of this summer's Furious 7 was the beastly black-and-red Charger assembled by Mr. Nobody's elite squad, later parachuted into the middle of nowhere by Vin Diesel's Dom Toretto on a mission to save Ramsey. (If that sentence didn't mean anything to you, you've got some catching up to do.&ampnbspStart here.) The seventh installment of everyone's favorite film franchise about family, LA, and drifting comes out on Blu-ray next week, and with it are a bunch of featurettes — including one that goes behind the scenes of Furious 7's wild action sequences. Needless to say, driving a raised hunk of Detroit steel down the side of a mountain doesn't happen without a little planning.Check out the featurette above the Blu-ray comes out on the 15th, but if you prefer your media digital, you can already buy Furious 7 on all the major services.
      Lenovo, Motorola, and Google are bringing Android Wear to China in the form of the Moto 360 smartwatch. The watches will work with any Android device — but they won't work with iPhones. It might not seem like it, but it's actually surprising to see this platform get released in the country. Unlike Android on phones and tablets, Android watches have relied heavily on Google's services — services that are not available in China. And so, Google has decoupled Android Wear from its normal dependence on Google Now and Google Play.In their stead, Lenovo and Motorola have turned to a Chinese company, Mobvoi, to provide search and voice recognition. While that means that Chinese users won't get Google Now cards, they will be able to search, perform voice actions like calling a taxi, and even dictate messages. So while the experience won't be identical to what's available elsewhere in the world, it won't be radically limited. Mobvoi and Sogui will provide servicesIn fact, Google needed to do "quite a lot of work" to decouple Android Wear from Google's services, according to David Singleton, engineering director for Android. One small example, instead of saying "Ok Google" to your watch, you'd say "Ni hao Android" before speaking to it. In addition to MobVoi for voice features, Sogou will provide the mapping functionality for Android Wear. Google also says that Chinese app developers will be able to install apps onto Wear devices — though of course those apps will be installed via local app stores, not the Google Play app store.Recently, The Information and The Wall Street Journal have both reported that Google is interested in bringing its services back to China — starting with the Google Play app store for Android. Google, of course, is not commenting — but sources tell those sites that the company would be willing to censor the apps in the Chinese version of its store. It would be an important move for Google as it continues to try to keep its Android platform from fragmenting too much.The tension between putting more of Android under Google's control and leaving as much as possible in the open-source builds has been getting stronger lately. Google has been pushing more and more features through its suite of Google Play services. The most notable might be the technology behind the browser software on Android handsets, which for many users now gets updated automatically thanks to Google's services.None of those updates get to China in anything like a timely fashion (if they come at all). That's presumably one of the reasons Google might be interested in coming back to China, albeit in a compromised way. Just as importantly, it ensures that there is consistency across devices and that most of them are on a relatively recent version of the OS.Android is getting more and more Google-ified over timeAnd that tension between Google control and openness is actually even stronger with Android Wear. Until this new version of the Moto 360, Wear has been more locked down than the rest of Android. Though Google is quick to point out that manufacturers are free to load up their own apps on these watches, they are not free to create customized versions that are radically different from the core of the platform. That may be one reason that both Samsung and LG have taken the time to create competing smartwatch platforms — they want them to have a differentiated experience and support things like cellular radios right away."There's a real need to be able to iterate quickly."Singleton says that Google is comfortable with this more locked-down strategy for Android Wear. "For Android Wear and wearables in general, we still feel the market is really early," Singleton says. "There's a real need to be able to iterate quickly... so that there's a good, consistent experience for users and developers." Singleton's not wrong keeping the platform more locked down ensures stability and consistency across devices that often look quite different from one another. But it also means we're not likely to see a bunch of  manufacturers create Android Wear watches in the same way we've seen them create Android phones.What does it mean, then, that the Moto 360 with Android Wear is getting released in China? Well, it means that the Moto 360 is getting released in China and actually not much more. Google isn't bringing search and the Play store to the mainland (yet). Android Wear still requires manufacturers to partner up with Google to release a watch (for now). Those two stories are the same today as they were yesterday.But will they be the same tomorrow? We'll leave the final answer to newly minted Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Back in May, I asked him, "Is your philosophy still 'we hope to get there but we're going to wait and see,' or are there going to be any changes there in the near future?" Here's his reply:It's a good question. We are going to continue providing Android to the fullest extent possible in China, so we are incredibly excited. [...] We deeply care about investing there. We would love to serve Chinese users with Google services as well, obviously. I think it will be a privilege to do that, but we need to be thoughtful in how we do it. We are open to newer approaches. We'll have to wait and see.We teach all our new writers never to end an article with "wait and see," but I guess when it comes to Google and China, rules were made to be broken.
      In a nondescript conference room at Google’s headquarters a few weeks ago, I paired my iPhone to a smartwatch running Android for the first time. I was there to ask Jeff Chang, the lead product manager for Wear, how he’d managed to get Android watches working with iOS and how much they could do with an iPhone. Then my first notification came in on my newly paired Huawei Watch and my carefully laid plans evaporated.“Um. Did something just happen with Sundar Pichai?” I asked. “Wait, what?” was the response. Oh, you know, he’s your new CEO now. Shall we go on with the interview? That’s how it goes with smartwatches. They’re meant to keep you from having to pull your phone out of your pocket. You’re supposed to glance at the notifications and smile inwardly, knowing that you can ignore that ping and focus on who you’re talking to. At their best, they do exactly that. At their worst, they derail a conversation.They’re also still nascent. Very few people have had to bother grappling with the idea of notifications and computers on their wrists, because not all that many people are buying smartwatches. There’s a real sense that everybody’s waiting to see how things shake out, and I don’t blame them. Smartwatches aren’t really ready for everybody yet, not the way that smartphones are. But the smartphone comparison is apt: nothing drove innovation in that space faster than healthy competition between Apple and Google. If competition is what it takes to get smartwatches ready for the mainstream, even Apple Watch users should be glad about Android Wear coming to the iPhone.    That’s right: beginning today, a select set of Android Wear smartwatches (and all future watches) will work with the iPhone. The app should be rolling out worldwide soon. It’s been a long time coming — and it means that Google will be challenging the Apple Watch on its home turf. Those Android Wear watches will be both cheaper and more varied than the Apple Watch — just like Android itself.      There’s an important caveat, though: when paired to an iPhone, Android Wear watches can’t do as much as the Apple Watch. Nor can they do as much as they can when paired to an Android phone. Right now, only three watches officially support the iPhone, two of which aren’t even available for purchase yet: the Huawei Watch, the Asus ZenWatch 2, and the LG Watch Urbane. Chang says that Google isn’t supporting older watches because it wants them to work right away, without software updates. "In order to guarantee a good experience, where out of the box it will work immediately and you don't have to do any fancy footwork, that's why it has to be the newer watches," he says. But I suspect that the Android community will find ways around that limitation for older watches in relatively short order.Assuming you have a compatible watch, the set-up process with Android Wear on an iPhone is easy. Install the Android Wear app, pair the watch to the phone, and tap through some screens to set up some basic preferences. After that, you’re basically done — though there are some deeper watch settings you can dig into.Let’s just run down the feature set, though be warned that there are funny little details to know about with each of these bullet points.Your notifications from the iPhone are mirrored on Android Wear. You get Google Now cards on the watch. There are a bunch of different watch faces — including select third-party watch faces — that you can install and use. There are a few native apps on the watch you can tap into, like Weather or a clever Translate app.Voice search works, including various reminders that you might want to send to Google Now.You can do fitness tracking on the watch with Google Fit.You can get rich notifications from a small set of Google apps, such as Calendar and Gmail.    That’s quite a lot, actually, and much more than I expected Google to pull off. The problem is that there are restrictions in iOS that prevent certain things from working. It’s easy (and partially true) to rail against the locked-down nature of the iPhone, but in our conversations, everybody at Google demurred from wishing they could do more. Instead, Google just worked with the tools that Apple makes available over Bluetooth — and they turn out to be quite powerful. Chang says that "Basically, like any other iOS developer, we work with Apple to make sure we understand and abide by their guidelines, what the policies for the apps are. That's what we're doing, and we'll continue to do that as we make updates to the app in the future."      And actually, there is apparently one restriction that Apple has backed off on: allowing apps to refer to Android in the first place. In the past, the powers-that-be in Apple’s App Store have rejected apps&ampnbspmerely for noting they also exist on Android and even for declaring they support the Pebble smartwatch. How and why Android Wear’s app became exempt from those restrictions is another question Google declined to answer.Android Wear does more (and less) than you'd expectApple also doesn’t allow competing app stores on the iPhone, nor is it likely that third-party app makers will be able to easily bake in more advanced support for Android Wear. That means that Google doesn’t (at least for now) offer third-party watch apps for iPhone users. It also means that the selection of third-party watch faces you can get are "curated" by Google and probably won’t offer the same advanced features you can get when you use Android Wear with an Android phone.Even with all those limitations, Google has managed to make Android Wear feel very nearly feature-complete, at least by the standards of what most people use smartwatches for. Getting those ambient Google Now notifications is great, and I was weirdly pleased to be able to swipe away notifications on the watch and know the same was happening on the iPhone. If only Apple would make swipe-to-dismiss as easy on its phone. Like the Pebble, Android Wear only receives the notifications that you have set to appear on your lock screen.    Google’s curated set of third-party watch faces probably has enough choices that you’ll find something you’ll like. Unfortunately, since it can’t do full-fledged third-party apps, many of the best Android Wear watch faces aren’t going to be available. But there are some good ones in there, including a pack from ustwo that I really like.      Everything on Android Wear works thanks to the Android Wear app on the iPhone — you don’t need to install Google Search or any other Google apps to use it. Voice search on the watch works really well, though if you tap the button that opens your results on the phone, you run into a weird situation. Since it has to work with the Android Wear app, you end up in an in-app browser inside that app. It’s not terrible, just strange.By speaking to your watch, you can set Google Now reminders, open the Weather app, set timers, and more. All of it is as good or better than Siri. You can also use the watch to control your music, but you can’t search for a specific song in Apple Music the way that Siri can.Voice search is accurate but limitedThe inability to communicate with other apps extends to other kinds of notifications, too. The most annoying is that you can’t reply to any incoming texts from your watch. You can reply to emails from Gmail, but everything else just shows you the incoming message. You have to pull out your phone even just to reply with a quick "Okay."But Android Wear does manage to offer some advanced features with Google apps. If you use Google Calendar or Gmail, you’ll get more detailed notifications than you would with the default apps from Apple. And Google cleverly auto-blocks notifications from some duplicate apps when you set them up. In fact, you can swipe on any notification on your watch to get to "block app," which is a scary term for a nice feature: it stops notifications from that app from hitting your watch. Sorry, Periscope (not really).    For Chang and for Google, all these nuts-and-bolts feature comparisons are beside the point. He feels that Google has nailed the basics: notifications, voice search, and Google Now cards. Based on my brief time with the watch, those all work and work really well. For the vast majority of consumers, the basics are going to be completely new. Rather than run down a checklist of features, Google hopes that consumers will be making their smartwatch decision based on other metrics. Namely, style and price. "Our vision is a lot of diversity of hardware choices." There are going to be probably half a dozen different Android Wear watches that will work with iPhones by the end of the year — if not more. Each of them looks different and, Google hopes, may appeal more to your personal style then the rounded capsule design of the Apple Watch. "Our vision is a lot of diversity of hardware choices regardless of what phone you use," Chang says. "You'll be able to get the watch you want." We’ve already seen a mix of round and square watches, most of which can also be further customized with off-the-shelf bands.More importantly, you’ll likely be able to get a smartwatch for significantly less than the $349 asking price for the base model Apple Watch. We don’t yet know the prices for the forthcoming Huawei Watch, new Moto 360, or any of the other Android Wear watches due to arrive soon. But there’s going to be competition between those manufacturers, and that’ll drive the price down. Many Android Wear watches currently sell for as low as $149.Asking somebody who’s not even sure that they want a watch — much less a smart one — to lay down upwards of $400 on a nascent platform is tough. Asking them to give it a shot for less than half that price is a different story. It’s a story Google will no doubt be telling constantly over the course of the holiday shopping season.
      Microsoft has a new Office tool that's really useful if you regularly take screenshots. Microsoft Snip, available in beta now, allows Windows users to capture screenshots and then annotate on them and record audio over the top. It can turn an ordinary screenshot into a screen tutorial, or just a neat way to share your thoughts about a document or image over the web. While Windows has long included its own Snipping Tool, Microsoft Snip is a lot more powerful.Microsoft Snip hovers at the top of the desktop so it's instantly accessible to create a capture from your desktop screen, webcam, or just a whiteboard to sketch up anything with digital ink. Basic captures are automatically copied to the clipboard, but if you add audio then it's automatically transformed into an MP4 file that can be embedded on websites or viewed from a URL hosted on Microsoft's servers (providing you opt to upload it). Otherwise, all screenshots are stored locally by default. It's in an early beta stage right now, which means that the email option in the app defaults to the desktop version of Outlook. If you're on Windows 10 and you don't use the full Outlook app then it doesn't fall back to the built-in Mail application just yet. Quirks aside, the URL sharing and embed features work really well (see below). There are a variety of screenshot and screen capture tools for Windows, but most of them aren't free. Microsoft Snip is being offered as a free beta for now, and there's an option within the app to send feedback straight to Microsoft about its features.
      When was the last time you used a fax machine? Those of us who are old enough remember a time not too long ago when you couldn’t walk into an office without bumping into one, and some enterprising individuals even went so far as to buy one for their homes. Now, in 2015, many people haven’t even touched a fax machine in a decade (or in their entire lives), but that doesn’t mean it’s hard to find one. Go to any FedEx, Office Depot, or Staples and you can send or pick up a fax, just like it’s 1985 again. And, starting today, that’s what you’ll have to do if you want to get the first look at future-obsessed pop band YACHT’s new album, I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler. Jona Bechtolt and Claire L. Evans spend a lot of time thinking about the future: what it is, what it means, and how even just the promise of it can shift culture. The future is often imagined in terms of things we’ll be able to consume (flying cars, hoverboards, Soylent), but implicit in that consumption is the things we’ll discard in its wake. "It’s not like technology is something that just develops in a single monolithic way and then as soon as it becomes obsolete it disappears and is replaced by something else," Evans said. "We live in a world in which we’re surrounded by things at varying degrees of obsolescence.""We’re surrounded by things at varying degrees of obsolescence."YACHT, which stands for Young Americans Challenging High Technology, began as Bechtolt’s solo project in 2002 (Evans joined the lineup in 2008). Their albums are often thematic — 2011’s Shangri-La explored the idea of utopias — and their sound is somewhere between aquatic pop and mechanical malfunctions. As musicians (with a healthy amount of side ventures), &ampnbspunderstanding how people consume things — and the propensity for some of these things to fall into disuse — is a continual area of interest for Bechtolt and Evans. Our inclination to forget or ignore once-common technologies when something a little better comes along has created a little graveyard of unused machinery full of CDs, Walkmans, landlines, and ThighMasters. It’s in this space of tech-neglect that YACHT finds inspiration for I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler.      Enter the fax machine. The band’s newest project gives fans an early look at the album cover — if they’re willing to interact with the real world to see it. First, fans must download YACHT’s single-use web app, Fax.Ink (designed by longtime YACHT collaborators Daniel Bogan and Matthew Spencer), that locates the nearest fax-service store. Then, the app will fax a copy of the album art to that store for the user to go and pick up. The first 300 people to do this not only get a physical copy of the cover art (a photograph by Luke Gilford), but they’ll also get a manifesto written by YACHT detailing the history of fax art. After the cover is printed 300 times, the web app will stop working, and, like the fax machine, will eventually fade into obscurity.There's another reason YACHT chose the fax machine as their album art messenger: its connection to sound. Evans says the way fax machines use telephonic tones to translate images interested her from a musical perspective. "A transmission that reflects or represents our sound, through sound, for people to physically pick up, is really compelling," Evans said.The transmission of images through soundEven still, why would a band so interested in what’s ahead want to ask their fans to go backwards? For YACHT, the fax project is a way to reimagine what near-obsolete technologies can be. "The fax machine existed in a time when it never really got to be explored as something beyond a business tool," Evans said. "What can we do to take that technology and activate it again? What can we do with the tools that we have now that didn’t exist in the peak of the fax machine’s popularity?"Then there’s the relationship between technology and the real, physical world. YACHT is asking fans to go pick something up at a store, but they’re doing it with the help of an app. Evans calls it "an analog distribution platform" that’s enticing largely because it operates outside of the internet — and it offers a degree of control that’s all but lost in the digital age. "We’re thinking about it as, ‘How can we release an image to the public in a limited way before it’s released to the public in a broad way?’" Evans said. "And the only way to do that in this age is to release it as a piece of paper."    But it’s more than just a piece of paper. It’s a physical artifact in a time when physical artifacts — especially in the music world — quickly become dusty fossils of a previous era. Online, the album art is just another .jpg, but as a fax, it’s a limited-run art piece translated by a fading technology. And of course, YACHT promises it will still look good. "We did a test to make sure it looks cool, and the fax gave it this whole other life," Bechtolt said. "It looks like it was made to go through a fax machine."YACHT has yet to release a single for I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler, but the album’s intricate rollout has already resulted in several projects, or what Evans calls "tiny monuments." The band announced their album last month by tweeting a link to Google Maps coordinates with a virtual pin. Shortly after, the band released drone-shot footage of Bechtolt and Evans standing on that corner. High above their heads was a big red billboard bearing the album’s name. After the album announcement, YACHT shared the track list in the form of a GIF-heavy listicle (a "tracklisticle") that was published on BuzzFeed last week. And after the fax project has run its course, YACHT says there will be more installments to come. "We’re in it for the projects right now," Evans said.So are fax machines the new record players? Probably not. But their continued use highlights the fact that, in some respects, the world now doesn’t look much different than it did 20 years ago. "I think we’re in a point now where we’re beginning to realize that the future will be much like the present, only hotter and louder and more crowded," Evans said. "The thing about the future is that it’s mundane." That may ultimately be true, but for now, YACHT will do what they can to make sure it’s not.I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler is out this fall.
      E-commerce has created a world of incredible, even disturbing convenience. The average American living in a major city can now outsource nearly every chore imaginable, while having everything she would ever need delivered to her home within a couple of hours. But along with the convenience comes a growing suspicion we may be overpaying. Prices on the web change constantly. On one day in 2013, Internet Retailer magazine found that Amazon changed prices on 40 million products. And price changes aren’t only about keeping up (or down) with the competition — they’re also increasingly personalized, with a mind toward pushing you toward&ampnbspthe highest possible price you will pay. A certain amount of price discrimination is expected, and is sometimes even seen as benevolent. Few strenuously object to a senior citizen getting a discount at the movies. But that kind of discrimination is transparent. There are other, more insidious forms of differential pricing, and they’re often invisible. Websites have been caught changing the prices you see for all sorts of factors, such as whether you’ve logged in, which browser you’re using, and what purchases you have made before. In other cases, retailers modify their search results to push you toward higher-priced items.Retailers modify searches to push you toward higher-priced itemsMost retailers allow you to request a partial refund in the event that the price of an item you purchased drops within 14 days or so. But the difference can be difficult to collect. Even if you find out that the purchase price dropped, each site has different policies and procedures for getting your money back. Some ask you to fill out an online form. Others make you send them email. And you have to be persistent: not every company grants your request the first time around. If you’re only going to save a few dollars anyway, most won’t bother.But to ask the most popular question in Silicon Valley — what if someone else just did it for you? That’s the idea behind&ampnbspParibus, a Y Combinator startup&ampnbsplaunching its iOS app today. The service, which launched on the web earlier this year, connects to the email address you use for shopping online. When Paribus finds a receipt, it monitors the price. And if the price drops, Paribus negotiates for a refund — while keeping a cut, typically 25 percent, for itself. (You can temporarily lower the fee to 0, in 5 percent increments, for every friend you refer Paribus.) Its negotiations are automated: it sends emails on your behalf, fills out online forms, and varies its messages to make them sound more human.    The app is like a concentrated version of the website with a useful new feature: a push notification whenever Paribus gets you your money back. Open it up and it will show you how much money you’ve spent on e-commerce, divided by retailer. A second tab shows you a feed of your recent purchases. And there are standard tabs to show you your profile, edit your payment information and shopping accounts, and share the app with a friend."There's so much great technology on the other side."The result is a service that helps protect you from price discrimination, while also encouraging companies to be more transparent in their pricing. "There’s so much great technology on the other side," says Eric Glyman, who co-founded the company with his Harvard classmate, Karim Atiyeh. "We want to build technology and a business that only succeeds if we’re building value for consumers."It’s this technology-assisted score-settling that appeals to me most about what Paribus is doing. E-commerce companies essentially have unlimited resources to manipulate you into higher prices. Aside from the odd credit card that offers some purchase protection, consumers are essentially on their own. Glyman says Paribus’ incentives are aligned with shoppers: it only makes money if you do. (It also won’t sell your purchase information to marketing companies or anyone else.)Still, there are some important caveats with Paribus. Most worrisome is the idea that they have access to your email, and send emails on your behalf. The founders say it’s all automated, but still, it will give some the willies. The company recommends signing up for Paribus with a new email address, and using that email address exclusively for shopping.    Eric Glyman (left) and Karim Atiyeh.There’s also the question of how major retailers will respond to the service. (I was most interested in what Amazon would have to say about Paribus it did not respond to a request for comment.) The founders say it’s in the interest of companies to work with them, because customers who trust they are getting the best price will shop at a store more often. At the same time, Paribus acts as if retailers will be less likely to offer refunds if it were ever discovered to be a bot: it is designed to make all of its communications seem as if they were written by the customer. If it were to reach a significant scale, the service would eat into what are typically razor-thin retail margins.Technology-assisted score settlingAt the very least, price monitoring will likely continue to be a cat-and-mouse game. Retailers already go to great lengths to avoid letting competitors scrape pricing information from their websites this will only evolve. And I wouldn’t be surprised if some e-commerce outlets tried to block Paribus outright.But that would only prove its point: that for all their claims of low, low prices, e-commerce companies are often working invisibly to push them upward. Until now, the technological advantage has belonged to them almost entirely. Paribus is a welcome effort to begin leveling the playing field.Paribus is&ampnbspnow available on iOS.
      Windows 10 is now available as a free upgrade for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users. While millions are performing the upgrade this week, Microsoft is working hard on updates and fixes behind the scenes. Some of those patches have already started rolling out, but there are more to come. The first bigger collection of fixes will come with what Microsoft calls Service Release 1 (SR1). Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge that SR1 is due to be released in early August, possibly as early as next week. While SR1 won't include new features, it will fix some of the issues people have been experiencing with Windows 10.After the initial patches and updates, Microsoft is working toward a bigger collection of fixes and feature additions for later this year. Tentatively scheduled for October, some of those additions will include a new Messaging app to provide Skype integration and extensions support for the Microsoft Edge browser. "There's no one working on a Windows 11, but there's a group of people working on some really cool updates to Windows 10 that the Windows insiders will see soon," says Microsoft's Windows chief Terry Myerson in&ampnbspan interview with The Verge. Windows 10 testers will start to receive new builds shortly, with the ability to test new features like Microsoft Edge extension support before it's available more broadly later this year.    Windows 10 testers will see Microsoft Edge extensions soonSpeaking to The Verge last week, Microsoft Edge program manager&ampnbspDrew DeBruyne revealed a little more about how extensions will work in Microsoft Edge. Extensions will be javascript-based, and Microsoft is trying to mimic exactly how Chrome extensions work so it's easy for developers to port them across. In the screenshot above you can see how a Pinterest extension is integrated in a similar way to Chrome. "The intention is that there’s not much work to do, or zero work to do," explains DeBruyne.&ampnbsp"We’re doing a lot of work to essentially support the same APIs that Chrome does." Extensions will be hosted in the Windows Store alongside regular apps, and developers will be able to sideload them.Microsoft's dedicated Messaging app for Windows 10 will enter preview in the coming weeks. The messaging app will bring Skype integration directly into Windows 10, creating a&ampnbspmore iMessaging- and FaceTime-like service. Microsoft is planning to release this to Windows 10 users later this year, but insiders will get to test it very soon. You'll be able to make video and audio calls all without a dedicated Skype app, and Skype messaging will be supported through the built-in Messaging app.    Outside of features and app updates, Microsoft is also working on the basics. Windows 10 battery life isn't exactly where the company wants it to be. "We are ... I want to be able to say it's the best battery life, but right now we're about equal to Windows 8.1 updates," explains Myerson. "We're pushing for some fixes to say we're better. Still, 8.1 update had very good battery life, so we're in no way stepping back."Further out, Microsoft is also working on a&ampnbsp"redstone" wave of releases for Windows 10 that will add more features in 2016. While existing built-in app updates will roll out regularly over the coming months, redstone may introduce new apps as part of two summer and fall updates due next year. The big push of&ampnbspWindows as a service continues.Verge Video: Windows 10 review
      Windows 10 has a lot to live up to. Microsoft has made a lot of promises about it. And oddly enough, we’ve heard most of them before, with Windows 8. Both were designed to acknowledge and embrace mobile and mobile apps, work well on touchscreens as well as laptops, and form the basis of a new phone platform. But there’s a big difference between them: Windows 10 actually does all those things.      The story of Windows 10 from inside MicrosoftThe company's latest trick: listening to its usersBy Tom Warren Windows 10 has a lot to live up to. Microsoft has made a lot of promises about it. And oddly enough, we’ve heard most of them before, with Windows 8. Both were designed to acknowledge and embrace mobile and mobile apps, work well on touchscreens as well as laptops, and form the basis of a new phone platform. But there’s a big difference between them: Windows 10 actually does all those things.Three years ago, tablets like the iPad looked like they might be a serious threat to Windows. In response, Steve Ballmer, Steven Sinofsky, and the rest of Microsoft took a big bet on a forward-thinking interface that asked its users to forget their old point-and-click ways and embrace a tiled future. Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 were related pieces in a bold strategy to move the company into a future of touchscreens and connected apps.That strategy flopped. Users roundly rejected the confusing new version of Windows, and without them, developers balked. But the iPad hasn’t killed off laptops, and consumers haven’t shown a big interest in touchscreen PCs yet. Another version, 8.1, attempted to stem the bleeding, but it was too late. The market had spoken. Like Vista before it and Windows ME before that, Windows 8 was the version of Windows you skipped. Read our full Windows 10 review Now, a new leadership team for Windows under CEO Satya Nadella and executive vice president Terry Myerson are trying it all again. But this time around, the goal is much more ambitious: if they succeed, Windows 10 will be the final iteration of Windows: The one that will be updated like a service, continuously, in perpetuity. The one that finally makes good on all the promises of a synergistic ecosystem of like-minded devices designed to work together.In a series of exclusive interviews with The Verge, the team behind Windows 10 revealed how they’re doing it, why they think it will succeed, and what they’re working on next. This is the story of Windows 10 from inside Microsoft.    Terry MyersonDeveloping in the openTerry Myerson never imagined he’d last at Microsoft. "I thought I was going to stay here a couple of weeks, but found that I really loved the people."It’s now 18 years since Myerson sold his small company to Microsoft, during which time he worked on Exchange, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone. Now, he’s sitting in front of me as the head of Windows, just days before the software maker launches Windows 10. It’s been two years since Myerson was promoted to the top job, and the release is important to him and the company.  Microsoft needs customers to love and want Windows enough to upgrade to it, thereby creating a massive install base to attract developers. The pressure is on.Myerson is confident without being arrogant — he’s more than happy to tease me about my MacBook. His forthright manner is mirrored in how he chose to release Windows 10: out in the open, bugs and all, even before the company had finished thinking through what it should be."You're putting it out there when it's not done."Microsoft now solicits feedback directly from users in a very public way: over the past nine months, the company has been testing Windows 10 with 5 million "Windows Insiders." Anyone can sign up to test, and the results of Microsoft’s work will go on display today as Windows 10 launches to millions of people around the world."It has sometimes been daunting," says Myerson. "You're putting it out there when it's not done, then you're getting all kinds of feedback and stuff that you know is broken." That feedback has been constant and varied over the last nine months, and it will continue over the months and years ahead.Initially, "there was a lot of hand-wringing around what was that going to be like and were people going to form opinions too early," explains Gabe Aul, engineering general manager for Microsoft’s operating systems group. "I think we just decided to go for it."Aul launched his Microsoft career in product support 23 years ago. He went on to help build Dr. Watson, a debugger that gathers error data when your PC crashes, into basically every product at Microsoft.Today Aul is the face of Microsoft’s Windows 10 testing. He receives Microsoft feedback, praise, and abuse on Twitter daily, but he remains perfectly cool. Even before we start our interview, I start moaning about some Windows 10 bugs I have, and he’s keen to listen, even emailing me a fix for a problem within seconds.He admits he’s "passionate about quality" after working in product support for years, and it’s clear he genuinely cares. While many will joke IT support is simply a help desk asking a user to reboot their PC, Microsoft has built a whole system to process the feedback it receives for Windows 10. It all gets collected in a database where Microsoft engineers can use tools to analyze it visually. If Cortana starts breaking in France, Microsoft will hear about it, and engineers can detect trends and issues based on pop-ups that appear for testers."There was a lot of hand-wringing around what was that going to be like."Feedback doesn’t always come from within the operating system, though. The Continuum feature, which lets you switch between desktop and tablet modes in Windows 10, generated a wave of negative responses from  social media. That’s probably because Microsoft initially ripped out all of Windows 8’s good touch work, a move that surprised testers, before slowly building it back in. "The trash can icon — the feedback we got on that thing..." He cuts short to laugh because Windows Insiders (myself included) were really vocal in comments and online forums about the how ugly the first version was.Sometimes, Windows customers reached out to Myerson directly, including one during the time when the Windows chief misspoke and the result was that everybody thought Windows 10 would be free. "There's this kid in Bangladesh who somehow got my email address, he runs pirated Windows," Myerson says. "It was a great dialogue. It was more for me a learning experience about how did he pirate Windows, and why did he pirate Windows." The conversation hasn’t changed Microsoft’s stance, though. Windows 10 still isn’t free for pirates.    The new Xbox One app on Windows 10Taking feedbackTo handle feedback, the Windows build team hosts daily "flight ops" meetings to decide which prerelease versions of Windows 10 get released. A "flight commander" takes control of the team, for that day. "He has a red hat that says ‘phone’ on it, and he has a black hat that says ‘PC’ on it," Aul says. "When it’s time to talk about phone, he will take the PC hat off and put the phone hat on. That’s how we keep the room in check."@mikevierling It's real :-) pic.twitter.com/dwF9EJOQkQ— Gabriel Aul (@GabeAul) May 20, 2015There’s also a red outfit hanging on the wall, a symbol of a time when one employee came to the ship room wearing embarrassing matching red shorts and a T-shirt (he’s an Ohio State supporter). It became a running joke. Now, if a Microsoft engineer enters the meeting with a bug that’s equally embarrassing, they have to wear something red.To continue with the red theme, Aul has a 3D-printed red button that’s become something of a Microsoft meme among Windows fans. Aul hits it when a build is ready to be released to the public. "It’s mostly ceremonial, but it actually does send a trigger to the flighting system," explains Aul. "The other thing it does, that most people don’t know, is it says something inappropriate in a Stephen Hawking voice because it’s got a voice synthesizer in there." Aul wouldn’t give me any examples, but quotes are sourced from the team or jokes about his tweets.Microsoft’s willingness to solicit user feedback on early versions is a big change from the past. During the days of Vista, Microsoft’s lawyers ended up at my doorstep because I dared to write about prerelease versions of Windows. And while Windows 8 had a few public previews, it was largely developed with little consideration to feedback. Windows 8 shipped despite user concerns about fullscreen apps and a lack of attention to keyboard and mouse users. Microsoft’s management seemed to spend more time explaining every new feature in sprawling, technical blog posts instead of understanding why users hated the changes.Myerson has a different philosophy: "It isn't one guy comes down from a mountain with a tablet [saying] what the right product is," he explains. "We just believe the customer feedback shaping the product is how we're going to build clarity and confidence that we have a great product."    Joe BelfioreFrom apps to phonesMicrosoft may have been confident about Windows 8, but the ambitions to push touch computing didn’t work out. Microsoft has been forced to admit several times that it’s aware customer satisfaction rates for mouse and keyboard users are low. Microsoft’s new Start menu isn’t as domineering, it’s just designed to get them to move to Windows 10. "Our strategic belief is, if we have a big audience of people… then developers will put apps in that store because there will be demand," explains Microsoft’s Joe Belfiore."We now have all the devices lined up. I don't expect to see the platform change again."Belfiore looks after the customization of Windows for PCs, tablets, and phones. He spent years building Windows Phone, alongside Myerson. To many fans, he’s the face of Microsoft’s mobile efforts. Microsoft has been constantly resetting and rebuilding its Windows Phone OS. Windows Phone 7 users couldn’t upgrade to Windows Phone 8, and it took far too long for Windows Phone 8.1 to arrive with features that should have been there from the beginning. It’s knocked developer confidence, to say nothing of crippling its chances at gaining significant marketshare.Part of Windows 10’s big promise is that the same apps can run across PCs, tablets, phones, and even the Xbox One console. As a result, the next phones will have an expansive set of apps from Windows 10 to jumpstart the ecosystem. "We have one common operating system for all the device types that we are making," explains Belfiore. He’s also surprisingly blunt when he characterizes Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, products he was intimately involved in developing.  "We've had a couple of, sort of, practice runs with phone and PC," Belfiore says, before pivoting to the presumably brighter future with Windows 10, "We now have all the devices lined up. I don't expect to see the platform change again, in the same way it has before."That’s encouraging to hear, but it doesn’t help Windows Phone right now. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed recently that the company is restructuring its phone business, scaling it back massively as part of a $7.6 billion write-off from the Nokia phone business acquisition. Around 7,800 jobs are being cut, and Microsoft is planning to make fewer models. "We are going to focus on a few great devices and the most notable being that premium consumer category," explains Myerson, adding, "The direction we will head is the premium-branded lineup." I push him on whether that’s a similar approach to Surface, and he claims "the goal is to have one Microsoft device family that plays this role in the Windows ecosystem." I’m not sure if that means a Surface Phone is in the cards, but it sure sounds like it.The first example of that one Microsoft device family will arrive later this year. "One's coming. Maybe two are coming, but at least one is coming," teases Myerson, as he hides an unreleased Lumia phone in his pocket. Microsoft is rumored to be working on two high-end devices that will include a new Continuum feature from Windows 10. Continuum on phones lets you use the phone as kind of a PC. You can connect up a keyboard, mouse, and monitor and start using Windows 10 apps. "I think it is the future of the phone," says Myerson.Belfiore is equally bullish about Continuum, but the phone version of Windows 10 doesn’t ship until later this year. "The phone is significantly feature complete, but we'll continue to polish and tweak and iterate the things that still need to work," explains Belfiore. "We'll put features in right up near the end. But in general, the broad feature set is set."    Phil SpencerWindows 10 and the Xbox OneWindows 10 is also coming to the Xbox in a big way. A new Xbox app for Windows 10 is a significant addition, and it’s one of the best built-in apps available right now. You can stream Xbox One games to a Windows 10 PC and use the Xbox controller, and you can chat freely from a PC to an Xbox One with or without a headset. It’s a great addition for Xbox gamers after a rough couple of years. Sales have been second to Sony’s PlayStation 4, but it feels like Microsoft is recovering from the original unveiling of the Xbox One two years ago. "The launch of Xbox One, it was from a brand and a customer pride standpoint… a tough time," says Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s head of Xbox. "A lot of the original ideas around Xbox One didn't meet the expectations that Xbox fans have of what we should do with our product."Spencer, who has worked on products like Encarta at Microsoft, has spent the last year or so getting the Xbox team re-centered on its fans and gaming. It’s an approach that Myerson says inspired the Windows Insider program. "Xbox had this passionate focus on their fans and engaging with their fans and listening to their fans," says Myerson. "Something that Phil Spencer just has at his core is his caring. He lives for those Xbox fans.""We understand if you're going to go PC to Xbox, we need to get keyboard and mouse working."Spencer sees Windows 10 as a "massive opportunity" to bring Xbox Live and a single store to people. Today, the Xbox store is separate from the Windows store, but Microsoft is unifying them this fall. That doesn’t mean apps will be immediately available on the Xbox One, though. "Getting to one store where all the content is there will happen a little bit later," says Spencer, meaning we’ll be waiting until next year until we finally see Windows 10 apps on Xbox One. Microsoft’s store isn’t designed to kill off Steam, either. "Five years from now, I want Steam to be incredibly popular and successful. I look at the health of Steam as a harbinger of the health of Windows gaming."What is coming this year is a Windows 10 update for Xbox One that brings a refreshed UI, speed, and Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant. "You can imagine scenarios of ‘Hey Cortana, what are most of my friends playing? What are most people watching?’" says Spencer. "The next step is being able to help you in-game, of really thinking about scenarios like ‘Hey Cortana, how do I get past this boss?’" Further out, Spencer says that streaming PC games to Xbox One is something he wants to enable. "We understand if you're going to go PC to Xbox, we need to get keyboard and mouse working completely so you could play those games. In terms of where we want to go with our platform, those are absolutely in the scope of things that we want to do."    Terry MyersonThe last WindowsMyerson and his team have shifted Windows 10 to a "Windows as a service" model, meaning regular updates instead of a major release every few years. It doesn’t feel like Microsoft really knows exactly how this is going to play out, but the Windows 10 release marks a milestone.The company simply can’t afford to make the mistakes of Windows 8 againBut it’s not the kind of milestone we’re used to. Windows 10, even at release, is not done. Right now, it’s all about updates that fix issues and bugs. If you upgrade from Windows 7 and Windows 8 this week, then you’ll start to see those regular updates, and they’ll install automatically to keep everyone up to date. Myerson is confident in the quality of Windows 10. "We look at these quantitative metrics and we think the quality's great, and we're continuing to fix more," he says. "We're going to keep fixing. We're committed to listen and respond. Every day we're shipping out new updates with 30 more fixes."That listening and responding sums up Windows 10. If there’s something wrong this time, then Myerson and his team will be listening. This can’t (and likely won’t) be another Windows 8 or Windows Vista mess for Microsoft. The company simply can’t afford to make those mistakes again. "Our goal is to roll out Windows 10 and build a base of millions of happy and engaged Windows 10 users," says Myerson."Happy and engaged" is one of those talking points you hear a lot from Microsoft. Myerson used it nine times in our hour together. But behind the PR-approved phrasing is a simple truth: it’s been a long time since Windows users have been either, and Microsoft needs to fix that. It’s as good a North Star as any, especially when your product development cycle is founded on taking user feedback seriously. If Microsoft can make people love Windows again, then the rest — developers and apps — is easy.If I’ve learned anything from speaking to the team building Windows 10, it’s that Microsoft is taking user feedback very, very seriously. Everything Microsoft is making — from the Xbox to phones to HoloLens — is based on Windows 10. It’s not just the foundation of this operating system, it’s the future foundation of the company. Microsoft doesn’t have a Plan B for Windows, and it’s proud of the fact: "There's no one working on a Windows 11," Myerson says, "but there's a group of people working on some really cool updates to Windows 10." When Windows Insiders see those updates, you can be sure Microsoft will want to know exactly what they think.* * Photography by David RyderEdited by Dieter Bohn and Michael Zelenko
      Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system debuts today, enabling Xbox One game streaming to PCs. While that's a neat feature for Xbox One owners, Microsoft is working on streaming PC games to Xbox One consoles too. In an interview with The Verge, Microsoft's head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, reveals the company is working on the feature. "We understand if you're going to go PC to Xbox, we need to get keyboard and mouse working completely so you could play those games," explains Spencer. "In terms of where we want to go with our platform, those are absolutely in scope of things that we want to do." "Challenge is good."The real challenge of getting PC to Xbox game streaming working is encoding games and having the right amount of bandwidth to stream them to the Xbox One. Streaming from Xbox One to Windows 10 PCs is a lot more predictable "because we know exactly what you have," says Spencer. "It's actually a little more challenging doing the encoding on the PC side to the Xbox, but challenge is good." There's no timeline on when this might arrive, but it's clearly a challenge Microsoft is willing to tackle.It's early days for Xbox and Windows integration, but if the Xbox app is anything to go by then the future of gaming on Windows 10 is going to be interesting. "[Gamers] want to play games on the device that they want to play on. They want to play with their friends and they progress whenever they sit down," explains Spencer. "Because of that, the roadmap and our focus on what's going on, Windows is incredibly strong."Verge Video: Streaming Xbox One to Windows 10
      When Microsoft originally unveiled the Xbox One nearly two years ago, the software maker was focused heavily on entertainment. Reaction was swift and critical from fans, and the launch quickly turned into a disaster. Phil Spencer, Microsoft's Xbox chief, took over the role around a year ago and he has re-centered the company's focus on gaming. In an interview with The Verge, Spencer has shared some of his vision around the future of the entertainment features in the Xbox One.While as much time is spent watching entertainment on an Xbox console as playing games, Microsoft appears to be looking at new ways to bring entertainment features to the Xbox. "We probably have taken a little different approach than we did at launch," admits Spencer. "We've been thinking a lot about over-the-top and over-the-air conent and how the aggregation of all your content in this un-bundled world that people seem to be living in." Part of that has seen the company launch Xbox One digital TV tuners, and Spencer says the company will continue down that type of path. "I'm not sure we have as much value to add there.""Whether I think I'm going to become an additive thing to your cable box... I'm not sure we have as much value to add there in the long run where I think about where the space is going." That's not surprising. Almost every Xbox executive we profiled for its TV integration has&ampnbspleft the company. While the Xbox One promised deep interactive TV integration, the result has been a mix of IR blasters and UI on top of cable boxes. Spencer now sees Xbox adding value in helping people find the right TV show or the ability to watch content streamed from an Xbox to other devices. "We see what people do on the box and we know making advances in the entertainment space is important," he says. "You'll hear more from us soon actually about that."Rumors have suggested Microsoft is working on a DVR feature for the Xbox One to let you record TV shows. With Microsoft planning a bigger presence at the Gamescom event next week, it's possible we'll see some announcements around entertainment. "I think there are natural features that you could see where an Xbox could do a god job helping, especially in a world where you have video sources from all over the place," teases Spencer. That sounds like a hint at might what might get announced next week. The Verge will be reporting live from Gamescom, so stay tuned for all of our Xbox coverage.
      Even at a company where executive turnover is the norm, running Twitter's product organization has been a particularly precarious job. When Kevin Weil took the reins in October, he was the fifth person to take the job in five years. Improving Twitter's core product while growing its user base was a challenge Weil's predecessors never quite cracked the man he replaced, the former Google Maps executive Daniel Graf, lasted a mere six months. Inside Twitter, there was confidence Weil could succeed where past product leaders failed. Unlike Graf or Michael Sippey before him, Weil is a Twitter insider: he joined the company in 2009 as a data scientist and steadily rose until he became responsible for all of Twitter’s revenue-producing products. In his first few months since taking over the product team, Weil has overseen the release of several small but meaningful changes. Among them: improving tools for reporting abuse and harassment unveiling a new home page for people who haven’t signed into Twitter inserting popular tweets that you may have missed into the timeline and letting you&ampnbspmessage multiple people in direct messages.The changes have boosted morale within Twitter among the employees I’ve spoken with. But Twitter itself remains as turbulent as ever: Dick Costolo&ampnbspabruptly stepped down this month in part because of pressure from Wall Street to grow the company’s number of active users more quickly. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has stepped back into the role while a CEO search takes place. And whoever takes the job permanently will be judged in large part on the performance of Weil and his team. How good are Twitter’s products? How many users will they attract — and retain?The company’s latest strategy is to build a version of Twitter that shows you its best stuff instantly, without you having to figure out who or what to follow. Twitter calls it&ampnbspProject Lightning, and it’s likely to define Weil’s legacy at the company. Over two wide-ranging interviews this month, I chatted with Weil about Lightning, Twitter’s latest CEO, and why they had to go and&ampnbspget rid of the wallpaper on your profile. Highlights are below the interview has been edited and condensed.How many users will Twitter attract?Casey Newton: You’re working with a new CEO now. What have your conversations been like since Jack came back?Kevin Weil: They’ve been awesome, actually. I’ve really liked working with Jack. Look, I loved working for Dick — I worked with him for five years. He’s been a great mentor to me, and I think he's obviously made a huge impact at this company. But Jack brings the vision of the founder of the product back, so he has a very strong sense of Twitter’s place in the world. He’s bringing his perspective to how we develop products, and honestly it’s been a great experience so far.Your team has consistently made moves to change the core Twitter experience. What are you up to?Well, let me step back and try and place it into a broader context. Here are a few places where Twitter is making really bold product choices. The first is that&ampnbsptweets are getting richer. We’re moving from a world of 140 characters to a world where that 140 characters is a caption onto a much richer experience, and that richer experience travels wherever the tweet goes. You’re seeing tweets come with photos, videos, Vines, GIFs, and Periscope, [which] is a huge opportunity in the future. But it’s not just that. Commerce is an example of this: you’re beginning to take actions through tweets. So there’s a lot that you’re going to see coming from us in the coming months around that."Tweets are getting richer."And then beyond that, we’re taking the timeline in a very new direction. Historically, the Twitter timeline has been about a set of reverse-chronological tweets from the people you've chosen to follow. That’s a great experience. Three hundred million people a month come to Twitter in a logged-in state, and that is their Twitter experience. And for people like you and me, we’ve spent a lot of time curating who we follow, getting to exactly the right amount, the right set of people, the right set of content, and we follow, we unfollow, we curate. We’ve put a lot of time into it. But the next 500 million people who come to Twitter aren’t going to put the same amount of time that you and I have into making our Twitter timeline the best representation of what’s happening in our world right now. And that’s our guiding light for where the Twitter timeline goes. We want, every time you open Twitter, we want to show you what’s happening in your world right now so that Twitter tells you first what matters to you. And so we’re evolving the way the timeline works. You’re seeing this with products like "While You Were Away," where for the first time, the Twitter timeline wasn’t reverse chronological. Maybe you went to bed the night before, you woke up in the morning, and you missed a lot of tweets can we summarize the best of what you missed so you really did feel like Twitter was telling you what was going on in your world?But that’s just one example of the work that we’re doing. The&ampnbspInstant Timeline, where for new users — rather than introducing you to Twitter by asking you to follow people, understand what "follow" means, understand all of our verbs and our actions, rather than doing that — with the Instant Timeline, we ask you a few questions that are easy about what you’re interested in — sports, music, news, et cetera. We understand from your address book who you know, and we know what they’re interested in on Twitter, so we can learn from that, and then we introduce you to Twitter through our content. The first experience you have of Twitter, 30 seconds after you sign up, is a timeline of tweets that are relevant to you right now based on everything we know about you. And from there you can follow people as you decide that you like what they’re expressing on Twitter, and you evolve yourself into more of a normal state on Twitter. But we’re introducing you to Twitter through the content. So those are two examples of how we’re evolving the timeline, and in general, our product direction is focused on making sure that Twitter tells you what’s happening in your world, first.The most important thing you’re working on now may be Project Lightning. What’s the vision for this product, and how close are you to being able to show it off? With 500 million tweets a day, everything that happens in the world, happens on Twitter. Literally everything that’s going on, there’s somebody with a phone, taking a photo, posting a video, putting it on Twitter. But it’s tough to find all of that content, even for you and me, who are expert Twitter users. And so Project Lightning is a bold take on how we can deliver that value to users instantly, without making them go and find it themselves. The idea is that we can give users a new experience, a guide to what’s happening on Twitter right now. It doesn’t need to be a big event like the World Cup or the NBA Finals or the Oscars. It could be a meme that’s breaking on Twitter. It could be a conversation that’s happening. One great example is the VMAs and&ampnbspall the chatter that was going back and forth — Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift, and Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran going back and forth and making fun of each other. If you don’t follow all four of them, you missed that. But these conversations are amazing, they’re only on Twitter, and Project Lightning is a way to bring these moments together."Project Lightning is a way to bring these moments together."What does it look like? How does it work?There are a couple new concepts we’re introducing. Part of Project Lightning is around human curation. We have a team of folks who are selecting the best tweets around what’s happening now, so we know that everything is super high quality and we can focus on providing a great experience around every individual tweet. So it’s a very different way of doing Twitter than a timeline is, and it also allows us to introduce some new concepts in the direction of showing you what’s happening in the world right now.One of the things we’ve talked about with Project Lightning is the idea of a temporary or an event-based follow. The idea is that as the VMAs conversation is playing out, in Project Lightning, you’re getting the best of this particular conversation. You’re seeing it curated live, so you can go and flip through it in a very immersive view of this conversation. You can also follow it, and when you follow the best tweets from that conversation or that event or that location or the game or whatever, it will be added to your home timeline as they happen. So it’s again breaking this notion of a purely reverse chronological home timeline where the tweets are only from the people you follow, and reimagining it to make it more about what’s happening now in your world that you care about. So what you’ll see when we can finally show you Project Lightning is that it’s instant, it’s immersive, and you can immediately understand what’s going on in your world as it plays out on Twitter. It will give you an entirely new appreciation for the richness and the depth of content on Twitter, but there’s also a beautiful connection between the home timeline and Project Lightning via this idea of a temporary follow. After the event’s over, the content from that Project Lightning event doesn’t keep getting put into your timeline. It’s just while it’s happening.How personalized can you get with this kind of thing? That’s a great question. Project Lightning will initially be geographically focused, and it will be a set of content that is the same for every user that comes to Project Lightning. And I think that’ll be great. It’ll spur discussions. You’ll know that there’s this sense of shared experience happening around these moments, these events. But over time I can definitely imagine it becoming more personalized. There are a few different ways we’re thinking about doing that. It’s definitely an opportunity for us.Lightning: geographically based first, personalized laterHow different will Lightning make Twitter feel for core users?We’re being very thoughtful about it. So for you as a power user, you’ve taken a ton of time — you’ve put a lot of effort into getting the exact right set of people to follow. And for you, your home timeline is very good. It’s a very true representation of who you are and what you care about. And it’s very real time. That’s not true for every single user. So for you, we may not make a lot of modifications. For other users who are newer to the product, or who don’t follow a set of people that produces a great timeline — for those people we can do a better job of bringing them what matters most to them right now.You mentioned bold changes. And so I should ask — why is the wallpaper going away on Twitter.com profiles?Here’s what I will tell you — it is not so that we can put ads there.You just wanted a cleaner look?A cleaner look that sets us up to make some changes that we have in the hopper.A recent area of focus for you has been in handling abuse, particularly abuse experienced by women. What else do you want to do in this area? And do you have any data to suggest that what you’ve done so far has improved the situation?It’s a good question — it’s something that is critically important to us, as you’ve seen from our focus on it. I don’t think we have any data that we’ve shared.That’s literally why I’m here. So you can share with me.It will be an ongoing area of focus for us. We’re never done when the work is protecting our users. We ultimately feel that this kind of work actually enhances free speech on the platform because it makes people feel safe to state their own opinions. So it’s incredibly, incredibly important to us. Free speech is at the very center of who we are. I can tell you we see and we feel that we’re making an impact. And there are various public tweets that we’ve seen from folks who have been involved in this in the past that they feel that there’s progress. But we have more to do, and we’re not going to stop."Free speech is at the very center of who we are."How do you measure that, though? If you improve the reporting tools, you’ll probably see more reports. So how do you measure your effectiveness in handling abuse on the platform?There’s only so much I want to say about that. I don’t want to reveal too much of our metrics because then we help the people who are doing the abuse learn the system. So I’ll stop there.Just before you took over, Twitter tried to reset its relationship with developers by launching Fabric, your suite of developer tools. And just a few months later, the first app to really take off on the platform in a long time — Meerkat — got its wings clipped when you shut off access to Twitter’s social graph. Can developers trust Twitter? And is Fabric generating meaningful results now?Fabric has been doing fantastically well. We’ve had a number of announcements since our developer conference at Flight we’ll have more in the future, and hope to bring everyone together as well and talk about what’s happened in the past year. That product continues to add enormous value in the lives of the developers who are actually building the apps that we use day in and day out. It’s experienced a lot of growth as a result.With Meerkat, we have great relationships with Ben and his team. We still talk fairly frequently. They still are heavy users of the Twitter API.Let me ask about video. Like a lot of big social players, Twitter has made a big push around video this year, striking deals, improving the product. What is Twitter uniquely positioned to do with video?We just made some&ampnbspbig announcements around auto-play, which have been great. We’ve heard great responses from users around auto-play. So that’s exciting, and that gets at our mission of enabling users to understand all the great content that’s on Twitter. You don’t have to press play on the video it just starts and you’re drawn in. So that’s a big step for us in mobile video because it isn’t just Twitter video. It’s also Vine, and it’s also Periscope. Both of those products are very valuable with their own set of users, their own app, their own communities. And that’s amazing. They also can post content to Twitter, and their content is represented authentically within our product. And so both Vine and Periscope enrich your experience of Twitter, and I think we can do more than we do today to help you see the best of Vine, the best of Periscope when you’re in those products or when you’re on Twitter."We need to put more of a focus on our desktop apps."Sounds like that could be part of Project Lightning. Who knows? There are so many possibilities.Development on your desktop apps has tended to lag far behind the mobile apps. Do you see value in investing real resources in, say, the Mac client or Tweetdeck, or is that just a distraction from trying to win on mobile devices? The thing that drives us is building great experiences for users wherever those users are. And it isn’t just Twitter-owned and Twitter-operated apps. We also think about our logged out experience, which is primarily on the desktop. And we think about our syndicated experience — syndicated tweets in desktop websites and in mobile apps through Fabric. So we care about the Twitter experience wherever users are.We’ll have more to say on a couple of those things in the future. But I can tell you it’s absolutely a priority. We do think about building a great mobile experience first. It’s the most immediate, powerful use of Twitter. But we absolutely need to put more — effort is the wrong word — more of a focus on our desktop apps. And you’ll see those improving rapidly, in the same way that you’ve hopefully seen the mobile apps improving rapidly.Recently Twitter has talked a lot about wanting to capitalize on the millions of people who visit it every month without logging in. Are you getting good results from your new home page for logged out users? How will it evolve?Logged out in general is a massive opportunity for us. We have over 300 million active users, but we have over 500 million people coming to our various logged out properties [every month]. So there’s an incredible amount of folks coming in to look at individual tweets, to look at profiles, to do searches. And some come straight to the home page. So&ampnbspwe focused first on building that home page product, because we wanted to have a great front door, a great introduction to Twitter to teach people how the product works and what it is. But now we have an opportunity to connect all these experiences so once you start on Twitter as a logged out user, you can browse endlessly from one place to the next. You look at a tweet, and then you look at related tweets. From there you look at someone’s profile. From there you look at one of our focused streams about what’s happening now on a topic you care about — say, college football. And we can create an endless browsing experience. Because again, there’s so much amazing content on Twitter, and it’s our job to do a better job connecting users to the content they care about it.Is there an opportunity to create a logged out mobile experience, so you could browse the Twitter app without an account?There may well be.How do you feel about the rollout of Twitter commerce so far? It seems slow to me.We’re being thoughtful and making sure we get the experience right before we go and put buy buttons everywhere. We want to make sure that when you see a buy button, the flow toward a purchase is quick and easy, that the feedback that you get once you make a purchase makes sense, that you know the right places to follow up. We want to make sure the buy buttons you do see are incredibly relevant for you. And we’re taking our time being thoughtful about it so we get that right.A Twitter take on instant articlesOne of the things Twitter does best is point people to other places: to articles and videos on other websites. Recently the mobile web has come under a lot of fire for offering a terrible experience, and Facebook has kicked off what I assume will become a trend by offering to host content natively inside its apps. How do you think about the mobile web? And how far along is your own take on "instant articles"?(Laughs.) How very presumptuous of you!Honestly, I can’t imagine you won’t do it. But if there’s an alternate perspective, I would love to hear it.The thing we focus on at the end of the day is when a user clicks on a link, you want to get them to their goal, to the thing they were trying to read and understand, as fast as possible. Instant articles is one route to that. We think there may be others. And we also think there may be other approaches, and we’re exploring those. I’ll be cryptic and leave it at that.
      An all-star crew has assembled on the Isle of Man this year to film IOM TT, which promises to be one of the most beautiful and in-depth looks at one of the deadliest races in the world. An annual event that's taken place for over a century, the TT is a complex road course that spans the majority of its namesake isle, where top-tier superbikes and their riders go all-out — often just inches away homes and people. On-board footage from motorcycles in the race can be terrifying enough to make you queasy.IOM TT's crew includes Chris Kippenberger of Studio Kippenberger (Jalopnik has a great writeup on his many talents), Robert Eder (whose credits include&ampnbspthe trailer for Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit), and Luke Huxham, who previously shot&ampnbspUnderground Hero, a lovely short film on the wild cars of Japan's underworld. From the trailer, Huxham's latest effort looks to be just as amazing.    (Stephen Clarke)"People talk about it, but very few know and comprehend what [the TT] actually is, how it works and how nuts it is. The proximity of death is all around, it's like something people talk about like another cousin who might pop in... it's weird. First day we shot a French rider [who] died running straight into a wall. No one knows why and how," say Kippenberger and producer Daniel Siegler, who just wrapped filming last weekend, in an email to The Verge.IOM TT launches on Vimeo on-demand June 26th as a $4.99 rental.
      That dreaded 20 minutes of fruitless searching for a place to park in a crowded urban center, driving 10 miles per hour to the vicious sound of honking from irritated drivers behind you, could soon be a thing of the past. INRIX — which aggregates real-time road traffic information from a variety of sources and offers it to automakers, municipalities, and news outlets — will announce its On-Street Parking product at the TU-Automotive conference near Detroit later today. The service keeps track of parking availability on a block-by-block basis, which automakers will be able to integrate into their navigation systems.    An example of how parking data shows on BMW's prototype. Green indicates higher availability red is lower.INRIX uses a variety of data sources to suss out how much parking is available on a given block, and those data sources have grown considerably with the proliferation of connected cars: the company can often get indicators like location, whether cars' transmissions are in park or drive, and eventually, ultrasonic and LIDAR sensor data that can "see" open spaces. (Ford is actively working on a pilot program along similar lines.) It combines this with pricing data from cities and private parking facilities to offer complete visualizations of where parking is light, where it's heavy, and what you'll pay at each spot. Cars that use INRIX's data could, for instance, find the cheapest nearby parking and route you to it automatically.    This kind of information can produce some pretty stunning pictures of a city's ebb and flow — see the animation above, for instance, which shows parking demand fluctuate throughout the course of a day in San Francisco's Civic Center area. BMW is demonstrating On-Street Parking using a specially fitted&ampnbspi3 at the conference today, and it'll be debuting the service in production vehicles later on.Parking availability services aren't new Parkopedia, for instance, catalogs real-time availability and pricing, and is&ampnbspavailable in-car on Ford's AppLink. But by incorporating data coming off individual cars, INRIX's service may be the most advanced — it can get a sense of availability even when spaces aren't wired with sensors to detect the presence of cars. (As is often the case with connected car services, privacy is a concern here, but INRIX notes that data is already anonymized by the time it receives it.)The service launches first in&ampnbspSeattle, Vancouver, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Cologne, and Copenhagen, expanding to a total of 23 cities by the end of the year. Only BMW is a part of the initial announcement, but it's likely that a variety of automakers — already INRIX customers — will jump on board.
      Over the last year the music industry has been in flux as artists, labels, and streaming services jockey over the best way to build the future of their business. Taylor Swift pulled her catalog from Spotify Tidal launched a new platform owned by artists, not record companies and Apple is preparing to muscle in on the market with its own offering. The one thing missing from much of this discussion has been the details on how deals get done between these groups, but that is no longer the case.The Verge has obtained a contract between Sony Music Entertainment and Spotify giving the streaming service a license to utilize Sony Music’s catalog. The 42-page contract was signed in January 2011, a few months before Spotify launched in the US. Written by Sony Music, the two-year deal — with an optional third year that Sony Music could pick up —&ampnbspreveals how much Spotify must pay in yearly advances to Sony, the subscriber goals that Spotify must hit, and how streaming rates are calculated.  contracts like these have been kept secret, until now More interestingly, the contract details how Sony Music uses a Most Favored Nation clause to keep its yearly advances from falling behind those of other music labels, how Spotify can keep up to 15 percent of revenues "off the top" from ad sales made by third parties, and the complex formula that determines how much labels get paid per stream.This contract — like every other contract involving a music label and a streaming service —&ampnbsphas been secret until now. Given the myriad ways Sony Music came out as the winner, it’s worth asking who really should shoulder the blame for the lackluster streaming payments that artists like Swift have been complaining about —&ampnbspthe labels or the streaming service?At the request of the copyright owner, the contract has been removed.Spotify paid Sony Music up to $42.5 million in advancesIn section 4(a), Spotify agrees to pay a $25 million advance for the two years of the contract: $9 million the first year and $16 million the second, with a $17.5 million advance for the optional third year to Sony Music. The contract stipulates that the advance must be paid in installments every three months, but Spotify can recoup this money if it earns over that amount in the corresponding contract year.But what the contract doesn’t stipulate is what Sony Music can and will do with the advance money. Does it go into a pot to be divided between Sony Music’s artists, or does the label keep it to itself? According to a music industry source, labels routinely keep advances for themselves.According to a music industry source, labels routinely keep advances for themselves"I’ve worked at the major labels, and I’ve worked at the indies, so I’ve seen both sides of the business," says Rich Bengloff, president of the American Association of Independent Music. "A lot of the time, money that is paid outside of the direct usage doesn’t end up getting shared." Sony’s Most Favored Nation clause keeps those advances risingSony Music’s Most Favored Nation clause is the most intriguing piece of its contract with Spotify. Section 13 essentially makes every major aspect of the contract amendable if any other label has a better deal or interpretation of that aspect than Sony Music. Section 13(2) lists the provisions which can be amended in Sony Music’s contract if a better deal is obtained by another music label, including what constitutes an "active user," the definition of gross revenue, and any improved security provisions. Sony Music can call on an independent auditor once a year to determine whether Spotify has struck a more agreeable deal with any other labels.Having an MFN clause in a contract is standard for music licensing contracts, according to multiple sources. MFNs have garnered scrutiny in the past, and as part of its merger with EMI in 2012, Universal Music Group had to stop using the clauses in Europe for 10 years. But they remain legal in the US.Where the MFN clause truly comes in handy for Sony Music is when it’s used in conjunction with section 5, the "annual true-up of advances" clause. This clause makes sure Sony Music’s yearly advances from Spotify are on par with the best deal negotiated by any other label based on the percentage of market share. That means if another music label is getting paid $1 million by Spotify for each percentage of market share it has, and Sony Music is getting $600,000 per market share percentage, Spotify must pay Sony Music the $400,000 difference — known as the adjusted contract period advance — at the end of each contract year.Spotify can keep up to 15 percent "off the top" from select ad sales revenueOne of the murkiest clauses in the contract is hidden under the contractual definition of gross revenues in section 1(vi)(bb). The clause states that gross revenue includes "actual out-of-pocket costs paid to unaffiliated third parties for ad sales commissions (subject to a maximum overall deduction of 15 percent "off the top" of such advertising revenues)." In English, that means that Spotify can keep up to 15 percent of all advertising revenues generated by the ad sales that are handled by third parties hired by the streaming service.How much money that amounts to depends on a number of factors, including what percentage of Spotify’s ads are sold by third parties, and if it chooses to keep the full 15 percent to itself. Spotify may also use these funds to recoup the commissions it has to pay to the third-party companies it uses to sell its ads. Spotify has tried to counter criticisms about what it pays artists But regardless of the amount, it’s money that is not accounted for in Spotify’s gross revenue total, which is split 70/30, with 70 percent going to the labels and publishers and 30 percent to Spotify. Spotify pulled in €98.8 million ($110M) in advertising revenue in 2014. The company has gone to great pains to map out for the public exactly what it pays, in part as a public relations move to try and counter criticisms about what it pays artists. But in that detailed explanation, it never mentions this 15 percent. Sony Music was given up to $9 million in ad spots on Spotify which it could sell for profitIn addition to the advance Spotify must pay Sony Music, it is also required to give the music label free ad space on its service. The "credit for advertising inventory" clause mentioned in section 14(a) grants Sony Music a total of $9 million in ad space&ampnbsp($2.5 million in the first year, and $3 million and $3.5 million in the subsequent years). And the free ads don’t come at market rates either&ampnbsp— they must be given to Sony Music at a heavily discounted rate.Sony Music could in effect sell the free ads it has been given for millionsWhile it's possible Sony Music could use that ad space to promote its own artists, section 14(e) gives the label "the right to resell the credited inventory at prices determined by the label in [the] label’s sole discretion." Section 14(a) also requires Spotify to make an additional $15 million of ads at a discounted rate available for purchase by Sony Music. Sony Music could in effect sell the free ads it has been given for millions, and turn around to buy more ads at a reduced price. But that’s not all — in section 14(p), the contract states Spotify must offer a portion of its available unsold ad inventory to Sony Music for free to allow the label to promote its own artists.How does Sony Music make money from Spotify?Of course, the biggest question is how much Sony Music gets paid per stream, and well, it’s complicated. Section 10 shows how Sony Music separated its label fees into three distinct tiers —&ampnbspthe ad-supported free tier, online day passes (which no longer exist), and Spotify’s premium service. In each of those segments, Sony Music can pull in a revenue share fee that is equal to 60 percent of Spotify’s monthly gross revenue multiplied by Sony Music’s percentage of overall streams. (So if Spotify earned $100 million in gross revenue, the labels would would get $60 million. If Sony Music made up 20 percent of the streams, it would take home $12 million.)But there is another far more complex formula that can earn Sony Music even more money from Spotify. The contract has what’s known as the usage-based minimum and per subscriber minimum, covering the free and paid tiers, respectively. If the royalties from usage in any particular month are greater than what is paid out by the revenue share, Sony Music gets that amount instead.Under the usage-based minimum for the free tier, section 10(a)(1)(ii) stipulates Spotify must pay $0.00225 per stream, thanks to a discount that lasts for the length of the contract. If Spotify somehow missed its growth targets in the preceding month, that number could jump to $0.0025 per stream. These rates only come into play if the usage-based minimum exceeds the revenue sharing model.Streaming payouts are subject to a very complex formulaThe premium tier’s per subscriber minimum takes Sony Music’s label usage percentage and multiplies it by the number of premium subscribers on Spotify, multiplied by $6.00. Once again, this model is used only if the total payout exceeds the revenue share.While the amount Spotify doles out is often discussed in terms of payment per stream, the contract shows just how complex and variable that payment can be. It’s likely that some months the usage or per subscriber minimum could generate a bigger payout for Sony Music than the revenue share does, especially with a popular new release.Spotify has argued that while "it is possible to reverse engineer an effective ‘per stream’ average by dividing one’s royalties by the number of plays that generated them... this is not how we measure our payouts internally nor is it a reliable yardstick for Spotify’s value to artists." This contract shows why. How much do artists get paid?Even with this contract, it’s still difficult to tell how much artists are getting paid by Spotify.Sony Music is likely getting considerable payouts from Spotify each year, but what it does when it gets that money —&ampnbspand how much of those payments actually make it down to the artists —&ampnbspis still unknown. Some artists have clauses in their contracts to get a larger share of the streaming revenue, and some artists are still operating under CD-era contracts that only give them 15–20 percent of their streaming revenues."You can’t squeeze blood from a stone."Spotify has been renegotiating its licensing contract with some music labels, according to sources, and how those deals will shake out is still undetermined. But given the economics of Spotify’s first deal with Sony Music, it’s likely that Sony Music and other labels will ask for an even larger advance from the streaming service.In the wake of Swift’s departure from Spotify, many musicians rallied to her cause, vilifying streaming services that paid a fraction of a penny per play. But this contract makes it clear — the pay per stream rates aren’t the only issue. According to its financial disclosures, the majority of Spotify’s revenue, around 80 percent, has been flowing out the door to the rights holders. "You can’t squeeze blood from a stone," said David Pakman, the former CEO of eMusic and partner at Venrock. "Your beef can’t be with Spotify anymore." At least not with Spotify alone.Sony Music and Spotify declined to comment.Additional reporting by Ben Popper
      As service on Amtrak's critical Boston-to-DC Northeast Corridor returns to normal today, questions remain over the violent derailment of train 188 in Philadelphia last week that left several dead and dozens injured. Triple-digit speeds were reported nearing a curve with a speed limit of just 50, which seems likely to have contributed to the accident — but some sort of object had&ampnbspapparently hit another train along the route, and the NTSB has&ampnbsp"not ruled out" the possibility of objects hitting 188 as well.Still, speed has remained a central focus of the investigation,&ampnbspwhich has turned the focus to PTC — Positive Train Control, an established technology in the rail industry that uses a system of signals, computers, and GPS to prevent trains from going too fast and colliding with other trains in the event an engineer is incapacitated or makes a mistake. PTC is so promising as a tool for improving rail safety that the federal government has ordered its deployment across broad swaths of the US rail network by the end of 2015. And furthermore, the accident has led the Federal Railroad Administration to&ampnbspdemand that Amtrak "immediately" enable automated controls on the segment of track where the disaster occurred.But David Hughes, a former CEO of Amtrak, argues that the operator hasn't dragged its feet on deploying PTC — in fact, it was "moving as fast as it could," he says in an email to The Verge:In fact, both Amtrak and the freight railroads have been going full speed in implementing PTC, but there are some formidable challenges.  For the freight railroads, when PTC technology was mandated by Congress, the technology to implement it did not exist.  So, railroads and the supply industry had to effectively invent it.  Everyone agreed that it could be invented, but that takes time and lots of integrity and safety testing.  In addition, the system required radio spectrum that wasn't available.  So the railroads had to go out and buy up in bits and pieces the radio spectrum to implement PTC.  Moreover, even with spectrum, sites for new radio towers were required which had long permitting process.  Every tower had to be approved by the local Indian tribe to ensure it wasn't near some sacred site.  Permitting was a real mess. No doubt the railroads felt that PTC did not have enough benefits to justify the $10 [billion] or so in costs, but I believe, as an insider in the railroad industry, that they have moved with all due haste in implementing PTC. As for Amtrak, the equipment for PTC was already installed in the track at the time of the accident.  It had not been made operational because Amtrak had only recently received FCC approval for their use of the spectrum they purchased.  So, the timing was really unfortunate, but Amtrak was moving as fast as it could to implement PTC on that curve.Hughes is correct in saying that the FCC just recently signed off on Amtrak's PTC spectrum in the area:&ampnbspa blog post by the FCC's Roger Sherman confirms that approval came in March of this year, while also noting that railroads must acquire spectrum at auction or from existing license holders "by law" — basically, the FCC can't pull new spectrum to meet the PTC mandate out of thin air. None of that is to say that an earlier request for approval from Amtrak couldn't have necessarily gotten PTC deployed to that curve more quickly, however Sherman says that the FCC signed off on Amtrak's request "just two days after Amtrak submitted a final amendment" in March.It could still be&ampnbsp"up to 12 months" before the NTSB issues its final report on the root cause of the crash, the agency reports. Its next update on the investigation is expected later this week.
      A few months ago, Google's Play Music smartphone apps were updated to showcase the company's colorful material design interface. And today, Google is giving a similar fresh coat of paint to Play Music on the web. Load the company's music portal and you won't notice any drastic differences from what was there yesterday, but a slew of design tweaks have brought Play Music into a more cohesive experience that feels more app than website — and that's the whole point. "We're moving towards making the web feel more like an app and less like a series of web pages strung together by links," said Google UX designer Bryan Rea by email. "The new header, the slick transition as you scroll, the collapsible nav, new animations, these all feel like things you expect in an app not on the web." Aside from some updates to fonts and transitions, you'll also notice a much greater emphasis on artwork. High-resolution photos fill the screen behind every playlist, album, and artist bio page. "For the increased focus on big, immersive artwork, when you're listening to music, you can get lost in it (in a good way)," wrote Rea. "With the new album and playlist pages, you enter an immersive world focused on the music you're enjoying."  Another small change: the artist page has moved away from square photos in favor of circle crops — the same switch Android, iOS, and third-party apps have made when it comes to displaying your contacts. "We're trying to differentiate people from other content, making artists and bands first class citizens in the experience and not just another card," said Rea. "Circles feel more organic than sharp edged squares and rectangles which makes them a perfect fit for people's faces." Design talk aside, the most useful addition to this update is a new queue pop-over that you can toggle on by hitting an icon at the bottom right. Previously, this disrupted your music browsing and took you back to a dedicated queue page. Now, you can continue looking around for new music and quickly see which songs are coming up in your playlist. Google has also made some accessibility improvements, introducing "lots" of new keyboard shortcuts and Screenreader compatibility.Google is making these changes as it continues to compete against Spotify, Tidal, and soon Apple in the paid music subscription business. Play Music's two-pronged approach of combining&ampnbspgenerous free cloud storage with a paid, on-demand subscription service helps it stand out against those rivals. And unlike Tidal, which has somewhat shamelessly cloned Spotify's look and feel, Google's Play Music maintains a look all its own. As Spotify and Apple prepare to make news, this is Google's answer in the streaming music wars. It's not a bad choice. Below you'll find some more images of Play Music's refresh on the web. If you're not seeing the changes just yet, don't fret they're gradually rolling out over the course of the day.
      Universal Music Group has been the main music label leveling pressure against Spotify to abandon its free tier, according to sources. Earlier this week, The Verge reported that Apple has been pushing music labels to force Spotify to get rid of its free tier ahead of Apple’s relaunch of its Beats streaming service, a move that has drawn the attention of the Department of Justice and, more formally, the Federal Trade Commission, which is leading the inquiry. Spotify's issues with Apple don't end there — the way Apple runs the App Store has come under scrutiny from the streaming service and others in the industry."You would never dry up that revenue stream unless someone is making promises they ought not to be making."UMG’s disdain for ad-supported streaming services isn’t new. CEO Lucian Grainge said during an interview with Recode that he found free streaming tiers to be unsustainable in the long term, and noted that UMG was fully behind the paid subscription model. "Ad-funded on-demand is not going to sustain the entire ecosystem of the creators as well as the investors," Grainge told Recode. Regardless of the pressure, Spotify isn’t married to its free tier, according to sources, but it does strongly believe it drives users to its premium service, and currently has no intentions of giving it up. The free service also draws a significant amount of revenue — much of which goes to the music labels —&ampnbspand attempting to cut off a revenue stream goes against the music labels' usual practices. "You would never dry up that revenue stream unless someone is making promises they ought not to be making," a music industry source said.But Spotify’s issues with Apple extend far beyond the claim that world’s largest company is trying to convince music labels to kill its free tier. The music streaming service is also not happy about Apple’s App Store tax, according to multiple sources. Apple charges a 30 percent fee toward any sales through its App Store, and that includes subscription services. That means if Spotify wants to sell its premium subscription service — which usually costs $9.99 a month —&ampnbspthrough the App Store, it has to raise the price 30 percent higher to $12.99 to pull in the same revenue, while Apple can still offer Beats at a lower price. Spotify and many others in the music industry believe Apple’s App Store tax gives them an unfair advantage over the competition."30 percent is fucking bullshit."To make things worse, Apple’s rules disallow companies from redirecting users to the browser to get the lower subscription price. "Apps that link to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the app, such as a 'buy' button that goes to a web site to purchase a digital book, will be rejected," Apple wrote in its App Store review guidelines. That means if you tried to sign up for Spotify or Rdio or Tidal through their apps in the App Store, you would think they raised their prices, much like what happened last week. "I get that there’s some administrative burden so they should get some kind of fee, but 30 percent is fucking bullshit," one music industry source said."They control iOS to give themselves a price advantage," said another industry source. "Thirty percent doesn't go to any artist, it doesn't go to us, it goes to Apple."With the world’s largest music label and the world’s largest company both pushing for the end to Spotify’s free tier, it’ll be interesting to see how long Spotify can keep offering the service, or if it even wants to. "The biggest distributor in the world is trying to engineer the music industry to their satisfaction," said a source. "People are going to wake up and not like it."Spotify and UMG declined to comment. Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment.
      Microsoft is planning to replace the technology and interface of Outlook.com with Office 365. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the company is migrating all Outlook.com users over to Office 365 this year. Microsoft’s Office 365 service includes Outlook Web Access, and we’re told Outlook.com will start to align with this user interface and feature set. The Outlook.com name will remain for consumers, and the Office 365 technology will help power it separately as a free email service without the subscription benefits of Office 365.The primary reason for the migration is to ensure Microsoft’s Outlook, Exchange, and Office 365 platforms are aligned, and that means adding the consumer Outlook.com service into this mix to keep everything consistent. In an interview with The Verge last week, Microsoft’s general manager of Office Apps, Rob Lefferts, speculated there could be some UI changes as part of the swap. "I expect there will be some visual enhancements," said Lefferts. "We debated a couple of ways we could have gone about it, but given the other goals we have for Exchange, Outlook, and Outlook.com it seemed like the most straightforward way to do it."    How Outlook.com may look in future.Microsoft hasn't updated Outlook.com with major changes for months now, and the company recently&ampnbspkilled off Google and Facebook chat ahead of its migration plans. Any potential UI changes will likely involve Microsoft moving toward its Outlook Web App interface used on Office 365. It's largely similar to Outlook.com, so most Hotmail and Outlook.com users will already be familiar with any future changes. Microsoft's migration of Outlook.com will help the company&ampnbspprovide add-ins across Outlook for desktop, mobile, and web thanks to a single codebase that developers can hook into.
      The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are looking closely into Apple’s business practices in relation to its upcoming music streaming service, according to multiple sources. The Verge has learned that Apple has been pushing major music labels to force streaming services like Spotify to abandon their free tiers, which will dramatically reduce the competition for Apple’s upcoming offering. DOJ officials have already interviewed high-ranking music industry executives about Apple’s business habits, but it appears the FTC has taken the lead in recent weeks."All the way up to Tim Cook, these guys are cutthroat."Apple has been using its considerable power in the music industry to stop the music labels from renewing Spotify’s license to stream music through its free tier. Spotify currently has 60 million listeners, but only 15 million of them are paid users. Getting the&ampnbspmusic labels to kill the freemium tiers from Spotify and others could put Apple in prime position to grab a large swath of new users when it launches its own streaming service, which is widely expected to feature a considerable amount of exclusive content. "All the way up to Tim Cook, these guys are cutthroat," one music industry source said.Sources also indicated that Apple offered to pay YouTube’s music licensing fee to Universal Music Group if the label stopped allowing its songs on YouTube. Apple is seemingly trying to clear a path before its streaming service launches, which is expected to debut at WWDC in June. If Apple convinces the labels to stop licensing freemium services from Spotify and YouTube, it could take out a significant portion of business from its two largest music competitors.Apple has an antitrust monitor on its campus, courtesy of the DOJ after Apple was found guilty in an ebook antitrust case last year (Apple is appealing the decision), but it's not clear if that monitor is involved in this latest situation. The DOJ and the FTC aren't the only entity looking into Apple’s dealings with the music industry, either. According to the New York Post, Apple is being probed by the European Union’s Competition Commission to find out if the company is working with the labels to rid the industry of freemium services.Apple declined to comment.Update: May 4th, 9:15PM: This post has been updated to clarify the FTC's primary involvement.
      Once an EV buyer, always an EV buyer? Maybe not.A report from car buying service Edmunds says that in the first three months of 2015, there was a noticeable uptick in electric and hybrid car owners trading in their high-efficiency vehicles for traditional, fossil fuel SUVs. The number stands at 22 percent, Edmunds claims, up from about 18.8 percent during the same period last year and 12 percent three years ago. In other words, just because you buy a fuel-efficient vehicle once doesn't mean you've necessarily bought into the Prius and Tesla lifestyle forever — and that loyalty is actually falling over time.Many drivers buy electrics and hybrids for the environmental benefit, but for others, it's a simple, cold calculation: taking into account the difference in cost between a hybrid model and its non-hybrid stablemate, how long will it take to start saving money? As Edmunds notes in its report, pricy hybrids made for a more compelling case when gas was over $4 a gallon, because heavy drivers could realistically recoup their money within a few years. At today's average — under $2.50 a gallon, according to&ampnbspAAA's tracker — it would take far longer.This trend probably isn't hurting TeslaEdmunds reports that sales of EVs and hybrids are generally down, representing 2.7 percent of total new car sales this year versus 3.3 percent the year prior, which can probably also be attributed to the lower price of gasoline. The report doesn't break down loyalty by specific model, but it's likely that Tesla — where the premium price of the Model S precludes buyers who are primarily concerned with saving on fuel costs — isn't being hurt by the trend. Hybrids are likely the biggest victims, followed by inexpensive, lower-range EVs that compete with commuter cars (Nissan's Leaf and Ford's Focus Electric, for instance). The decision to move all the way up to an SUV, though, is a little puzzling.Assuming the gasoline market is due for an inevitable course correction as drills and refineries idle, many of these SUV buyers may quickly start to regret their decision — if not for the environment, for their wallets.
      If you've ever needed a couple cute cat photos to get you through the day, then BuzzFeed has some plans for the Apple Watch that you're going to want to hear about. The publication is unveiling two Watch apps today that are meant to deliver bite-sized takes on some of its more addictive content. The first of those apps is an Apple Watch version of Cute or Not,&ampnbspa BuzzFeed iPhone app that lets people swipe left and right to vote on cute animal photos."A good way to get your cute animal fix very, very quickly.""That's a good way to get your cute animal fix very, very quickly," Ryan Johnson, BuzzFeed's mobile engineering VP, tells The Verge. "We were thinking you'd just quickly go look at a few pictures of pets when you're in the need. You can get that little jolt of pet quick fix."   Cute or Not on the Watch is really that simple. Swipe a few times, see a few cats and dogs, and then lower your arm when you have something better to do. BuzzFeed's other app is a daily poll, which will ship as&ampnbspan extension of the existing iPhone app. It'll feature a single poll each day — questions include pressing subjects like "Who should Hermione have actually ended up with?" and "Which of these is the worst new word of 2015?" —&ampnbspwith each poll appearing only to Watch users."We wanted to go for a quick engagement," Johnson says. "Something that would take about 20 seconds or so. That's how we landed on the poll." Johnson describes both apps as experiments. They're BuzzFeed's first attempts at playing with the Watch to see how it can be used to engage with people. "We wanted to be at the forefront of new technology and what's coming out there and experimenting with new formats," he says. "Just generally, that's how we operate."&ampnbspBoth apps will be available today, so they'll be ready when Watches start arriving on Friday.   BuzzFeed has been increasing its focus on mobile apps since last year. It acquired&ampnbspa small developer back in December and planned to continue growing that team. Cute or Not was launched in February, and BuzzFeed is now working on a news app. It doesn't have specific next plans for the Apple Watch —&ampnbspnor current plans to monetize those two apps —&ampnbspbut Johnson says that BuzzFeed is interested in how the Watch can be used for communication. "That's one thing I think we're really excited about and watching to see where it develops," Johnson says. "Is this a way that people use to communicate with one another? If so, that's something we'd like to explore further."
      There are soon going to be a lot of ways to get news on the Apple Watch, but&ampnbspBreaking News is delivering what may be the first app to actually help break news, too. Breaking News is unveiling&ampnbspan Apple Watch app today that'll deliver alerts on local stories and stories of interest to you. But the app also has a small experiment built in: a tip button, which will send an alert straight to the Breaking News team's publishing system. "We’re expecting new users to tap it just for fun," Breaking News co-founder Cory Bergman writes in an email to The Verge,&ampnbsp"but over time we’re expecting more signal than noise.""Over time we’re expecting more signal than noise."As we've been seeing&ampnbspwith other Apple Watch apps, the tip feature is super stripped down. There's nothing you can do but tap it. When you press the button, it'll send your general location to Breaking News, and that's it — there's no way to offer more information or even tell Breaking News what the story is that you're looking at. The plan is for Breaking News' team to identify when there's something important going on and then search around to see what's happening. "This is wired right into our content management system, and it’s rather easy for us to run location searches in our tool," Bergman writes.If the tips feature seems to be working, Bergman says that it could eventually be included in the iPhone app so that it can reach more people. That's when he thinks things could really get interesting. "Imagine, for example, what an earthquake might look like," Bergman writes. "We’re already thinking about how a cluster of tips could automatically trigger location searches for editors, making it even easier for us to detect news from social media very quickly. ...Our goal is to get faster at detecting news near our users around the world."    That's critical for Breaking News, which has been focusing on local alerts on the iPhone and Watch. By default, to spare you from the horrors of not-so-important breaking news alerts, Breaking News' app will only send you information on what's happening around you. Breaking News says that you'll get about one of those a day. You can get many more updates if you want them, but they'll only come if you follow specific subjects and stories. Unfortunately, every alert you get on your phone will come to your Watch — Apple doesn't provide an option to change that — so you'd better make sure you really want them.As a news source, Breaking News' Apple Watch app is meant to be a lot like&ampnbspits Twitter account: something that will give you the gist on top stories. The app will hold five stories at a time, which are supposed to be a mix of local stories, major stories, and stories you're specifically interested in. The intention is to let you catch up on news with just a few flicks. "We’re big believers in the ideal of 'time saved' rather than 'time spent,'" Bergman writes. "If we’re hyper-efficient at giving people just the news that matters to them, we save them time and build loyalty in the long run."&ampnbspThat could be perfect for news junkies, so long as notifications don't drive them crazy first.Verge Video: It's finally here
      What goes up must come down — and if it's a drone you're talking about, it often comes down in the most unfortunate ways possible. It bounces off a tree trunk, smashes into a highway tunnel, or careens into the side of a building. It runs out of battery and falls into a body of water. Your four-figure investment is typically only as good as your ability to handle it once it's aloft — which is why I'm a bit anxious when I first take the controller for the Solo, which 3D Robotics is billing as the smartest drone ever.Competition for that title gets tougher all the time: just last week, DJI announced Phantom 3, the next version of its best-selling consumer drone, with improved cameras and the ability to live-stream video from the drone to YouTube. But Solo represents a step forward in a few big ways: onboard computers in the controller and the drone, allowing for enhanced controls full access to GoPro camera controls in flight (a first) and software that allows novices to create intricate multistep shots using just a couple taps. Solo also offers a level of customer support previously unheard of in the industry. 3DR will give you a 30-day money-back guarantee if your drone bores you and free replacement if Solo breaks while in flight.The company is betting Solo will appeal to drone enthusiasts and novices alike — and that it can begin to chip away at the consumer drone market that the Phantom helped create. It is a critical time for 3DR, which has raised $85 million from investors. “We are a player, but we are the underdog player,” says 3DR’s Colin Guinn. “How big of a defining moment is it? It is the moment. This is the introduction to the world of 3DR.”    Meet the GuinnmeisterGuinn came to 3DR from DJI, where he was CEO of DJI's North American division. He helped lead design and marketing efforts for the Phantom, the Chinese company's hugely popular consumer model. Thanks in part to a series of popular YouTube videos where Guinn showed off the Phantom’s capabilities, he became well known to hobbyists. One drone blog continues to refer to him in headlines as "The Guinnmeister."           But Guinn's relationship with DJI executives in China soured over business terms, lawsuits were filed, and last February he decamped with his team for 3DR. (Guinn declines to comment on the lawsuit, which was settled.) Now at 3DR, Guinn's official title is chief revenue officer. But his role at the company is much larger than the bean-counter title suggests: the new Solo drone is his baby, 3.3 pounds of precision-engineered flying plastic robot."We’re basically giving people a superhuman power for a thousand bucks."And even all that  doesn't really get at the main thing about Colin Guinn, which is that he is obsessed with drones. Because he once ran an aerial photography company, shooting scenes for Hollywood films, Guinn has an all-encompassing knowledge about how to make movies in the sky. When he speaks, what comes across is this overwhelming sense that to own a drone is to have a superpower — and that if you could only master that power, you could bend the universe a little more exactly to your will.He mentions the history of comic book and fantasy characters who have the ability to see the world through the eyes of a bird. "What is the difference between those powers and Solo, with a high-definition video feed coming from the GoPro?" Guinn asks. "We’re basically giving people a superhuman power for a thousand bucks."It's time for me to try out my powers.    Flying SoloOn a blustery day in Berkeley, California, we take a pre-production Solo unit onto the roof of 3DR headquarters. Guinn pops the drone out of a separately sold backpack and spins on the rotors. He snaps in the battery and attaches a GoPro to the gimbal. The whole process takes about 60 seconds.I pick up the controller and press a button marked "FLY." The rotors spin up, and suddenly Solo is safely in the air, hovering 10 or so feet off the ground. Autopilot keeps it roughly in place while I think about what to do next. We decide to shoot a selfie, a pre-scripted shot you can find in the app that runs on your tablet. With a couple taps, Solo zooms off into the sky, then slowly flies back in, keeping me perfectly in frame. We watch it all unfold on Guinn's iPad Mini, which snaps onto the controller and accesses most of Solo's functions. When it's all done, we save the video to the iPad's camera roll. If I wanted, I could post it to Instagram while I'm still flying.           Solo does more complicated shots, too. A "cable cam" lets you set up a virtual line in the sky and then have Solo traverse it automatically, as if suspended on a wire. We use it to create dramatic shots that rise up above the railroad tracks next to 3DR headquarters and smoothly pan to reveal the San Francisco Bay behind us. 3DR is already seeding Solo units with filmmakers Guinn says director Michael Bay's review of Solo, having used it once, was: "Fuuuuuck."I just fly Solo using trial and errorI'm no Michael Bay, though I'm pretty sure I could get the drone to explode if I could only figure out how to turn off the autopilot. Over a handful of 20-minute flights, I never even develop the muscle memory for what the control sticks do I just fly Solo using trial and error. It's a luxury that most drones simply haven't afforded up until now it helped me to relax and enjoy myself in a way I can't imagine being possible even a year ago.Toward the end of one flight, while trying to get a shot, I find myself walking backward while keeping my eyes focused on Solo overheard. THUNK. I trip over a small HVAC unit on 3DR's roof and fall flat on my ass. Various bits of plastic fly off the controller, and the battery comes loose, barely tethered to the unit.I'm dazed, my video team is laughing, and Guinn is asking if I'm alright. And Solo? It's still humming away up above me, perfectly content in the 20 mph winds, ready to do whatever I ask, with 70 percent of its battery remaining. We reassemble the controller and land it safely with two button taps.I crashed the drone didn't. Score one for the robots.    How it works3DR is unveiling Solo today at the National Association of Broadcasters Show in Las Vegas, and it will begin shipping in a few weeks. For a base price of $999, with an optional $399 gimbal for enhanced camera controls, Solo is the first drone to offer full control of a GoPro camera. (I asked GoPro what they liked so much about Solo, and they sent back a bone-dry statement that didn't really answer the question — I assume because they worried about offending their other partners.) But the integration turns out to be a big deal: with Solo you can start and stop recordings, or change the camera's frame rate or other settings while in flight. It's stuff filmmakers have been asking for forever.           Most drones use a single computer, located in the flying unit, and broadcast signals to it using a controller. Solo, on the other hand, has 1 Ghz processors in both the controller and the quadcopter. The processor on the quadcopter is devoted entirely to autopilot functions necessary to keep it aloft. Meanwhile, the controller serves as Solo's "frontal cortex," and operates higher-level functions — some of which will arrive through future software updates. (My favorite of these, which I used in a test unit, is a flight "rewind" feature — simply tap and hold the "pause" button, which normally functions as a kind of emergency brake, and Solo retraces its steps. It's expected to ship within 60 days from launch.)It's stuff filmmakers have been asking for foreverThe Solo app will warn you when your battery is running low, flying home automatically to ensure you make it on time. (You can override the feature, but the controller will start vibrating until you land safely.) 3DR is also rolling out the world's most expansive customer service program for drone owners, for a product where service has been downright medieval. (Drone drop into the ocean? Sorry about that! Feel free to buy another.)It's the first drone to offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you aren't satisfied with your purchase you'll just have to complete a five-question survey, providing data 3DR will use to improve future versions. Meanwhile, a team of nearly 100 in-house technicians will respond to calls for help, using the data that Solo continuously logs during flights.The Solo app detects crashes and will ask you if you want to submit a trouble ticket in the event something goes wrong. If it's your fault, 3DR will offer to sell you a refurbished unit at a lower cost. And if the flight logs show Solo was at fault, 3DR will replace your drone — along with your gimbal and GoPro, if they also perished — at no cost.    Catching up to PhantomWill all that be enough to make 3DR the biggest player in the game? We may soon find out. The company was founded in 2009 by Chris Anderson, the author and former editor of Wired, and engineer Jordi Muñoz. (Anderson had been inspired in part by a 2007 incident in which he crashed a camera-equipped, remote-control plane into a tree at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.) The pair met on a web forum Anderson created, DIY Drones, whose community had developed powerful open-source software for controlling flying objects. Today the company has 300 employees, with offices in Berkeley, San Diego, Tijuana, and Austin, Texas.Last fall 3DR introduced a consumer drone named Iris+. But it has lagged in sales behind DJI and Parrot, according to estimates from Gartner Research. DJI sold an estimated $500 million in drones last year for professional and amateur use, focused on aerial photography and videography. (Last summer, its Phantom 2 Vision+ was The Verge's pick for best consumer drone.) The market for consumer drones is still well under $1 billion, according to Gartner.But an FAA ruling in February finally gave explicit permission to what had previously been a legal gray area. And the cost of consumer drones is coming down, albeit slowly. The big three manufacturers are betting that if drones become a bit easier to use and develop an expanded range of applications, the market will grow more quickly."You press the button and you get the shot.""As the product becomes more sophisticated, the users can become less sophisticated," Anderson says. "In the same way the iPhone transformed the phone by turning it into a single button — all that complexity reduced to a single button — what Solo does is it takes all the complexity of flying and robots and data acquisition and turns it into what is effectively a single button. You press the button and you get the shot."It's in that sense that 3DR sees the latest drones as the start of a new age in drones. "The first era of our industry was getting robots to fly. It was super hard! But we got there," Anderson says. "The next era was making them easier to fly. I think we all got there. The next era is not flying them at all — making it so that their intelligence can be so profound that you can almost not care about the vehicle itself."    Life after gravityFor all the time I spend with Solo — I visited the team several times over the past six months, flying prototypes in Austin and Berkeley — I never see a true production model. Even days before Solo is set to premiere, the team is still refining the software and hardware. Guinn pays fanatical attention to the product, and he rattles off requests to the software team throughout my visits. ("He's killing me," one executive laments.)In my tests, Solo performs mostly as we would hope. But Guinn fixates on a small tremor in the gimbal that might make captured footage less than butter-smooth, and while it's quite windy for my last flight, I can't help but notice that Solo sometimes has trouble staying still. Instead, it floats around in a roughly 3-foot cube, and I wonder how that might affect the footage I shoot. Meanwhile, it's hard to see what I'm shooting, because the glare is so bad on the iPad Mini. (Not Solo's fault, of course, but it does affect the user experience.)Flying Solo is a blastFlying Solo is a blast, and yet I’m still not sure I see the regular use case for myself. Getting great shots requires travel, and bringing Solo with me on vacation will mean checking one more bag and lugging it around. There are only so many drone-shot selfies a person needs, no matter how fun they are to shoot. So while I’m convinced Solo will make it easier and more fun for novices to fly drones, I’m skeptical of how much it can broaden the market for drones beyond hobbyists and filmmakers.Whether or not there’s space for three players in the consumer drone market or not, 3DR isn’t content to remain in third place. The Guinnmeister may not want to talk about his days at DJI — about the fact that the Solo, had he stayed at the company, would have been the Phantom 3 that was announced last week — but there's no doubt that he wants to win. "We’re an order of magnitude less well known than our bigger competitor," he says. "But I think that’s all gonna change really soon." He notes that Solo is launching in 10 countries and will be available at thousands of big-box retail locations, featured in giant kiosks with flight simulators. "The world is about to know who 3DR is."    
      Google is working on getting its Android Wear smartwatch platform to work with the iPhone, and it is close to finishing the final technical details, according to a source close to the development team. If Google released it and if Apple allowed it on its platform, it would&ampnbspput Android Wear smartwatches directly in competition with the soon-to-be-released&ampnbspApple Watch for the first time.In its current state of development, Android Wear works along with a companion app on the iPhone and supports basic functions like notifications — as you can see in the photo below. As it does on Android, on the iPhone Android Wear also supports Google Now's ambient information cards, voice search, and other voice actions. It should also support some more advanced features with Google's own iOS apps, like replying to Gmail messages.     The LG G Watch R with a FaceTime notification from iOSBut beyond that, there are plenty of unanswered questions. Pebble, who makes a smartwatch that works with both Android and iOS, has managed to get features like music control and watch apps working on its smartwatch with the iPhone. So it's possible that Google could do the same.Some third-party developers have already&ampnbsphacked together a solution that makes Android Wear work on iOS. Another developer has discovered "iOS related code" in Android 4.4 that he believes implies that Google has been working on iOS compatibility for Android Wear. Last October, Android Wear product manager Jeff Chang didn't rule out the possibility that Google could be working on it, telling The Huffington Post that "We always want as many users as possible to enjoy our experience, so in terms of enabling more people to use Android Wear we're very interested in making that happen.""Apps or metadata that mentions the name of any other mobile platform will be rejected." But a bigger question is whether or not Apple would actually approve the companion app into its App Store. Certainly it doesn't have much incentive to do so in the middle of the launch of the Apple Watch, its biggest product launch in years. Google and Apple have a history of contentious app approval processes — Google's Voice app and Maps app have had issues in the past — though it's been quite awhile since the two companies have butted heads over apps. But here's another possible problem: way back in 2010 it came out that Apple may reject apps that mention competing platforms. It specifically&ampnbsprejected an app for mentioning Android. The&ampnbspguideline still exists today. Since Android Wear is called, well, Android Wear, that could be a problem.Apple declined to comment for this story. Google said it "has nothing to announce at this time."Meanwhile, we've also heard that Android Wear for Android will be getting a&ampnbspsignificant update in the near future, including support for gestures and Wi-Fi.Verge Video: It's finally here- Reviewing the Apple Watch
      Google isn't standing still with its wearable platform now that Apple has given the press a&ampnbspchance to use the Apple Watch. A source knowledgeable with Android Wear's product road map tells The Verge that the next software release will turn on Wi-Fi support, meaning that features like notifications and Google Now will work when a Bluetooth connection is unavailable. Most Android Wear watches already have Wi-Fi built in, so a simple software update should activate the feature for them.Along with the Wi-Fi update, there will be at least two additional, smaller updates. The first is gesture control. Users will be able to flick their wrist to scroll through notifications and Google Now cards, rather than needing to use their other hand to swipe on the screen. The UI will also get some tweaks, with easier access to both Android Wear applications and contacts. Finding applications in Android Wear right now requires either spoken commands or digging through an extra layer of menus. Most Android Wear watches already have Wi-Fi built-inJust yesterday, Apple revealed the last pieces of information about the Apple Watch that we were waiting for. Apple detailed support for what looks to be a&ampnbspsurprisingly robust ecosystem of apps and services that will work with its Watch, which will likely cut into any head start Android Wear managed to get. Google has recently become more vocal about Android Wear on its blogs,&ampnbspdetailing developer APIs for Wear and a growing&ampnbspecosystem of apps.Of course, direct comparisons between the two watch platforms can only go so far. Neither smartwatch works with the competitor's smartphone: Android users can't use the Apple Watch, and iPhone users can't use Android Wear. But because of that lock-in, it's important for both companies to work to maintain something like feature parity, so as to prevent users from wanting to switch platforms because they'd like to use a different smartwatch. That sort of concern may seem small while the smartwatch market is so nascent, but if Apple and Google have their way, it won't remain a small market for very long.Verge Videos:  Hands on with the most watch-like Android Wear device yet.
      As the momentum behind virtual reality slowly continues to build we’re seeing more&ampnbsptraditional movie companies dip their toes into the medium. Today Dolby is announcing a partnership with Jaunt that will bring its Atmos surround sound technology to the world of VR — and it may turn out that virtual reality is even a better fit for the technology than the movie theaters it was originally designed for.Jaunt produces short virtual reality movies for the Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard, using its own custom camera rig to capture visuals across a near-360-degree field of view. The user then watches the action play out, able to look around anywhere they choose. Their titles, like the Paul McCartney "Live and Let Die" live performance short or the monster movie Kaiju Fury, aren’t interactive in the traditional sense but they are immersive, and Jaunt CEO Jens Christensen says sound is vital."Audio is maybe 50 percent of the whole experience.""We’ve realized that audio plays a huge component in terms of delivering a compelling and truly transportive VR experience," Christensen told me during a recent briefing. "We actually think audio is maybe 50 percent of the whole experience." To that end, the company has previously relied on its own solutions, using a special tetrahedral microphone array to capture audio when shooting and delivering a 360-degree soundscape that matches the viewer’s head movements. But whether it’s sound effects or other elements, VR movies need more than what’s simply captured on set, and the ability to place those different elements accurately is integral to selling the overall illusion. That’s where Christensen says there are real advantages with Atmos.To understand why, we need to take a brief look back at how Dolby Atmos actually works. Whereas Dolby’s older 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound solutions broke audio down into a discrete set of channels, Atmos is "object based." What that essentially means is that each sound is treated as an individual object that the mixer can place anywhere in a virtual theater — including right above you — with the Atmos system itself then figuring out how to recreate that effect on the fly based upon the number of speakers in a given room. A thunder crash doesn’t get specifically thrown into the back left channel, for example it’s placed at a specific point behind your left shoulder, and the system takes it from there.Sound can be placed anywhere in a virtual space with extreme precisionIt works the same way on mobile devices, where Atmos rejiggers the mix in real time into a&ampnbspbinaural version for headphones. Given that Jaunt’s VR movies are essentially virtual rooms unto themselves to begin with, the object-oriented system is a perfect match. The result, says Christensen, is the ability to precisely place audio cues wherever the company desires. "That’s very powerful, especially in VR."To start off, the company will be releasing Atmos-enabled versions of three of its existing Google Cardboard Android apps: Kaiju Fury, the Paul McCartney piece, and the horror short Black Mass. I was able to try beta builds of each on a Nexus 5, back to back with the original releases, and there was a marked difference between the two. Black Mass — which puts you in the shoes of someone that’s been kidnapped for a Satanic ritual — fared best, really selling the illusion of being inside a garage while rain pounded overhead. More importantly, it was able to use audio to misdirect my attention at key moments and generate some real scares. I found the current version of Black Mass to be somewhat amusing the Atmos version was unnerving.VR is so young that companies are still developing the basic toolsThe McCartney piece and Kaiju Fury served better as tech demos: yes, audio was more specifically laid out around me, but I can’t say I felt the experience was necessarily stronger for it. And that’s the real takeaway here: VR is so young that companies are still developing the basic tools that will allow for the creation of powerful experiences. And while each new game or narrative short is a step forward, it’s rare that one comes along that feels like a real game changer.But having tools like Atmos-enabled VR at the ready is part of what will allow that creative evolution to take place. Joel Susal, Dolby’s director of augmented reality and virtual reality initiatives, said the company is "deeply committed" to VR, and while it’s only discussing the Jaunt partnership for now he said Dolby is looking to bring its technologies to a number of different partners.For end users, however, all that’s going to matter are the experiences themselves. Jaunt’s first Atmos-enabled apps will launch later this year for a handful of Android devices, with more titles — and more supported phones — slated to follow thereafter.
      Pebble’s offices are the typical mix of very serious work and casual, laid-back mess that’s endemic to startup culture in Silicon Valley. I’m here to see the company’s next smartwatch, and CEO Eric Migicovsky is eager to show it. But first we’re getting a tour of Pebble’s garage-turned-office, which sprawls across three buildings on a Palo Alto block and houses about 130 employees.Standing desks commingle with shades, designed to block out the California sun beaming through the building’s windowed roof, while employees tinker away at code and hardware prototypes. There’s an ice cream parlor around the block where Pebble employees can get free lunch and milkshakes by showing their Pebble watches at the checkout. (Migicovsky jokingly calls it “version one of Pebble Pay.”)So far, things haven’t been all that hard for Pebble it established itself as an early mover in the nascent smartwatch market thanks to weak competition. But that competition is going to change radically this year: Apple’s Watch is due to hit stores in just over a month and Google is without a doubt working on the next iteration of Android Wear. Two of the biggest software platforms in the world are about to make life very difficult for Migicovsky.To counter those threats, Pebble is making its most ambitious bet yet. There’s a new watch, sure, but Pebble’s broader ambitions go far beyond that. It’s launching the next Pebble as an entirely new hardware and software platform, a hub that can potentially be the center of a whole ecosystem of devices.As we finish the tour, we approach Migicovsky's standing desk, placed in the middle of the office. A few feet above it hangs a sign that reads “This is a Bullshit Free Zone." With the Apple Watch around the corner, it needs to be.    The first part of Pebble’s next move unsurprisingly centers around the new watch. Called Pebble Time, it’s about what you’d expect a third-generation Pebble to be. It's thinner and lighter than Pebble’s earlier watches, and it has a slight curve on the back that hugs your wrist. It retains the four physical buttons from the first two watches, and it uses the same size straps as Pebble’s first watch.But this watch has a few tricks up its sleeve. For the first time, Pebble’s smartwatch has a color e-paper LCD screen, replacing the black-and-white panels used on the Pebble and Pebble Steel. It’s not the same kind of display you’ll find on an Android Wear watch or the Apple Watch only 64 colors are available, and it has much less contrast, saturation, and resolution than other screens. It’s more like a Game Boy Color screen than a modern smartphone display. But it uses very little power and is visible in bright daylight, letting Pebble keep the display on all the time without using a lot of battery life. That helps preserve one of Pebble’s strengths over the competition: the company says the Pebble Time can last up to seven days between charges, far longer than other smartwatches.           There’s also a new microphone that, for the first time, allows for limited voice control: replying to incoming messages and recording voice notes. Migicovsky argues that voice control on other platforms can be hit or miss, so Pebble intentionally limited it on its new watch. "We wanted to make sure that we built a system that works," says Migicovsky. (Because Pebble isn’t as deeply integrated into your phone’s system as the Apple Watch or Android Wear, doing anything more would be difficult.) For similar reasons, Pebble Time eschews the more complicated heart rate monitoring and other health tracking systems Android Wear and the Apple Watch support and sticks with a basic motion detector to count your steps.But while the Time doesn’t really do that much more than Pebble’s earlier watches, Pebble is offering ways for other developers and hardware makers to expand upon its capabilities. Developers will be able to tap into the Bluetooth LE radio inside the watch to trigger various functions in other devices, making the Pebble a kind of hub for your wearables and letting you leave your phone at home more often. Pebble also plans to allow for more hardware integration in the near future in the form of custom wrist straps that plug into a special port on the watch and add functionality like heart rate monitoring. Time is suddenly no longer just another smartwatch in Pebble’s lineup it’s now a full wearable platform that can potentially integrate with countless other devices in your life — assuming Pebble can get other hardware developers on board.Time is suddenly not just another watch, it's a full wearable platformPebble Time is certainly the nicest watch Pebble has ever created, and it’s the result of over a year of development. The company started working on the Time project months before last year’s Pebble Steel was even announced. Pebble doesn’t expect to compete head to head with the Apple Watch’s design and materials, but it’s also pricing the watch considerably lower than even Apple’s entry level watch. The base model will retail for $199.    A hardware platform is nothing without software to control it, and Time is only half of what Pebble’s announcing today. Along with the new watch, Pebble is introducing a completely new operating system with a new interface based on a simple timeline. "We tried a whole bunch of stuff, and then we happened upon the biggest revelation of Pebble: the best interface for interaction on your wrist is actually time," says Migicovsky. He notes that every other watch is based around the concept of time, and a smartwatch should be no different. "Eighty to ninety percent of the things people were doing with Pebble could be displayed more effectively over a timeline."                The new software is a big departure from Pebble’s earlier efforts, in both functionality and design. Unlike the siloed app and watchface paradigm of before, Pebble’s timeline puts all your notifications and apps in a single, scrollable interface. It pulls in data from apps and services and displays them in a chronological order: Move down the timeline, and you might see an upcoming calendar appointment or flight information. Move back, and the timeline can show how many steps you took yesterday or the score of last night’s playoff game. The "present" or default setting of the timeline displays things like stock information, current weather, and, of course, the current time. It’s similar to Google Now’s intelligent, ambient notifications, but not quite as smart. On the other hand, Pebble’s system is more linear and predictable.Perhaps the most striking thing about the new software is just how polished it looks compared to the older platform, even in the non-functional demos I was shown ahead of the product’s launch. The utilitarian look and feel of Pebble’s older software has been swapped for whimsical and informative animations and transitions. The timeline and app cards take advantage of the Time’s new color display to convey more information than was possible with a black-and-white screen.Liron Damir, Pebble’s head of design and another former member of the webOS team, says a lot of the software design decisions were informed by the hardware characteristics of the Time itself. The Time’s color e-paper display behaves very similarly to the black-and-white version, and there are choppy, glitchy moments when it switches from one screen to another. "When designing this, we took the [characteristics of e-paper] into consideration and actually pushed further this glitch moment to where it is actually being stretched by animation," says Damir. The pixel art animations are designed to work with the hardware they’re happening on. They’re timed to be short, snappy, and concise, since they have to happen within a screen the size of a postage stamp.The focus on design makes Pebble feel more grown up than beforeThis new focus on design (Damir became Pebble’s first head of design when he joined the company last summer) gives Pebble a more grown up appearance than it ever had before. Much of the software on Pebble’s earlier watches felt very home-brewed, including the apps from large partners such as Yelp and Foursquare. The new software looks like something that belongs on your wrist, not something that’s merely tolerated there.One of the problems that Pebble aimed to solve with this new interface was scalability. The original Pebble software limited users to only eight apps on the watch, which Migicovsky says was intentional to keep the app list from becoming unwieldy on the small display. But with the timeline, apps can plug in data and make themselves known when it’s most relevant to you. Pebble now feels the arbitrary app limit is unnecessary, and sure enough, you can install as many apps as you’d like on the Time.                But if Pebble’s plans go as it hopes, you won’t even have to install apps to make the most of the timeline and your watch. The company is opening up access to the timeline via a web API, so apps and services can dump information into users’ timelines with minimal effort and, importantly, without a native Pebble app or companion app on your smartphone. The developers just have to provide the raw data, such as the time and gate of your upcoming flight, and Pebble’s software will format it in the timeline in a way that makes sense on the watch. At launch, Pebble is partnering with Jawbone, ESPN, Pandora, and The Weather Channel to inject snippets of information into the timeline, and it says more partnerships are on the horizon.Like the expandable hardware capabilities of the watch itself, this open access for services and websites makes Pebble’s software more of a platform than ever. While Pebble has had apps on its watches for years (and boasts over 6,000 apps and watchfaces in its store), the new software turns the Pebble from a device that runs apps on your wrist to something that can easily integrate into a larger connected ecosystem of devices and services. "Pebble is a wearables company so we designed this to work really well on a smartwatch," says vice president of product Itai Vonshak (an alum of the webOS teams at HP and LG).Imagine a sleep-tracking device pushing data into the timeline without requiring a specific Pebble app, or a connected car putting reminders in the timeline for its next tune up. These types of features are all hugely dependent on developers taking advantage of them, so Pebble has consciously made it as easy as possible to do so with basic web development tools. Since the new Pebble still uses Bluetooth to connect, you’ll need to have your phone near it for all these new features to work — this new functionality doesn’t change the fact that the Pebble is still an accessory to your Android or iOS phone itself.Pebble has a unique relationship with its developers, often polling the crowd for new ideas and incorporating them into its flagship products. The company’s office is full of tinkerers constantly trying new things with development boards, whether that’s converting xckd comics into a format that can be read on the watch or making an animated watchface out of the intro to Super Mario Bros. Vonshak notes that it was outside developers that first demonstrated that Pebble’s basic hardware could support complex animations, which the company in turn incorporated throughout the new operating system.The new software incorporates things Pebble learned from its own third-party developersVonshak says the new software will still support all of the existing apps already developed for Pebble’s old system, but they will be accessible through what the company is calling app faces, outside of the timeline itself. Watchfaces will be able to replace the face Pebble uses in the default setting of the timeline, though developers will be encouraged to update them to support the Pebble Time’s color capabilities. Pebble also plans to bring the new software to its older watches, but the company hasn’t said when that will happen.    The company is releasing the Time and its new software platform exclusively on Kickstarter today, just like it did with its first watch back in 2012. It’s a strange move for a 130-person company that’s already sold over a million watches and has raised almost $26 million in outside funding, but Migicovsky thinks it’s important to give its most ardent supporters first access to the new device. "We want to take Pebble Time to them first," says&ampnbspMigicovsky."This is not just a product launch for us, this is not just a single product," continues Migicovsky. Perhaps more important than offering Pebble to early supporters first, Pebble is using Kickstarter as a marketing strategy, a place where it can post more announcements to counteract the impending Apple Watch PR blitz. "This is the beginning of the next generation of Pebble," Migicovsky says. "We’ve planned an entire month of announcements with new features of this product that you don’t even know yet, as well as some new stuff that we’re going to be showing off.""This is the beginning of the next generation of Pebble.""We’re there [on Kickstarter] because we wanted to introduce Pebble Time to the people who supported us, the people who were standing by us the last three years, to say, ‘We liked your product so much we’re going to support it and be the community around it,’" says Migicovsky.Pebble arguably helped to legitimize Kickstarter when it raised over $10 million to product the first Pebble watch, but that was back when the company only had a handful of employees and no track record. Now, Pebble’s products are already in thousands of retail locations across the world, including major stores like Best Buy and Amazon. It appears that the company is using Kickstarter less to "fund" the new watch and more as a way to publicize its plans and make some sales before it’s actually able to ship.Pebble won’t be able to actually put watches on shelves before Apple does, but it expects to ship devices starting in May. The Time will cost the full $199 when it launches in broader retail channels later this year, but Kickstarter backers will be able to get a watch for as little as $159.

It didn’t take long for Apple and then Google to radically disrupt the smartphone world, turn them into devices that virtually everyone wanted, and practically stamp every other player out of existence.That same dynamic is looming for the smartwatch and wearables market, and it’s going to take a lot of hard work, ingenuity, and perhaps a touch of luck for Pebble to avoid becoming the BlackBerry of the smartwatch world. Pebble will not only have to prove that there’s room for a third smartwatch platform, but that its smartwatch is the one that deserves to be there."There is no one else in the world that's as focused on building the next generation of computing on wearables than Pebble."As the sun sets on Pebble’s office, a crew of employees heads over to the ice cream parlor. Not to put too fine of a point on it, the flavor most appropriate for the coming days is Rocky Road. Migicovsky seems keenly aware of the challenges that lie ahead."I think it would be a disservice to the world to say there’s only going to be two smartphone operating systems and by definition those are the two smartwatch operating systems as well," argues Migicovsky. "There are years and years ahead of us in improving the technology and building new functionality and building new ways that we can interface between your smartwatch and the rest of your life. There is no one else in the world that’s as focused on building the next generation of computing on wearables than Pebble. That’s why we’re here, this is what we do."    
      For decades, architect Eli Attia has been filling notebook after notebook with ideas for a new way to think about constructing buildings. He developed a process he calls Engineered Architecture — a system that he says would radically simplify every aspect of the construction process. Attia describes it as new approach to every aspect of architecture and construction, potentially revolutionizing the industry. He began developing the system in 1996 and calls it his life's work, although he's coy about many of its specific details. Five years ago, he took it to Google X to turn it into working software. Now, he says they’ve stolen it.Engineered Architecture should have been the perfect project for Google’s moonshot program: a bold idea, a brilliant architect, and an ambitious plan to reshape one of the world's fundamental industries. But only about a year after the venture began at Google X, it split apart, and within months branched off into an independent business called Flux Factory without Attia’s involvement. Now, Attia says the new company is profiting off his work, and he’s making his case in a million-dollar trade secrets lawsuit against both Flux and Google, naming Larry Page and Sergey Brin as personal defendants.The case is a window into one of the most idealistic and secretive arms of the Google empire, raising new questions about how Google X manages intellectual property. Did Google steal Attia’s ideas, or did it simply move on without them? Were Google X’s ambitions a cover for a mercenary business deal, or just a pretense for the lawsuit? And as Flux Factory looks to change the construction industry, are they building on someone else's ideas? In 1985, Attia designed the Republic Bank Building (now owned by HSBC) around the bank's historic headquarters off New York's Bryant Park. Attia's biggest advantage in the suit is his reputation as an architect, built up through decades of high-profile projects. While working for Philip Johnson in the ‘70s, he conceived and designed California’s famous Crystal Cathedral, before spinning off his own firm and designing the landmark skyscraper at 101 Park Avenue in New York City. He became the face of a new geometrically minded school of architecture, lecturing at Harvard, Columbia, and the Museum of Modern Art and taking on projects from Seattle to Tel Aviv. In 1982, a New York Times critic described his style as "blending his love for architecture and his love for mathematics to come up with highly innovative geometric designs in his buildings." Attia says Engineered Architecture was born out of a similar impulse, a desire to automate the complex challenges of architecture and engineering."A revolutionary process poised to change the face of architecture."At its core, Engineered Architecture provides a set of as many as 100 different modular design blocks that can be combined into "any and every conceivable form," as Attia describes it. A 2008 patent application lays out a series of blocks that can set different curves for the outer wall of a building. (The patent was later abandoned, but a petition to renew it has been revived.) But Attia says Engineered Architecture is more than a simple design tool, that it extends to the pre-design, fabrication, and construction of the building itself. In the complaint, it is referenced as "a revolutionary process poised to change the face of architecture and construction around the world."Attia says he started looking for a partner for the Engineered Architecture system in 2010, hoping to transform it into a next-generation architecture software. That ambition brought him to the attention of Astro Teller, who had recently co-founded Google X, the company's secretive research branch. Google X was still new, but Attia says Teller was looking for "an idea to change the world," and thought Engineered Architecture might fit the bill.Soon after his correspondence with Teller, Attia gave a talk at Google's Mountain View headquarters, kicking off a long courtship with Google's top executives. Attia describes a string of meetings with Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Google X co-founder Sebastian Thrun. The leadership team seems to have been smitten by Attia's ambitious ideas and by the architect himself. "The short answer is, I’ve become a believer in this," Teller wrote to Larry Page, Sebastian Thrun, and another executive in an email obtained by The Verge. Teller then laid out options to either fund the project or "help me decide this idea is stupid and we walk away from it." In the summer of 2010, Google moved ahead, beginning talks with Attia about a Google X architecture project called "Genie." It was one of the first projects X would take on, and Attia was part of the original team, eventually joined by a project lead named Nicholas Chim who was pulled from within Google. At the same time, Attia began designing a house for Thrun, work that would continue long after he parted ways with Google.Astro Teller at a conference in October 2014 (Kimberly White/Getty Images)  What was the goal of Project Genie? According to Attia, the goal was to simply translate the Engineered Architecture system into software. Through his lawyers, Attia quotes Teller saying, "[Eli] invented the technology, and he's here to translate his brain into software." Attia didn't have the software expertise or business infrastructure to make Engineered Architecture into a successful software product, so he looked to Google X to provide it. Given his considerable fame as an architect, he expected to be calling the shots on the architecture side."The short answer is, I’ve become a believer in this."Google and Flux haven’t filed any legal answer to Attia’s complaint, but the team seems to have viewed Genie differently, with Attia’s tools as just one of many avenues to follow. (Google X declined to comment.) Even though he had been part of Genie from its earliest stages, Attia's employment documents describe him as just a consultant, and Genie had another architect, Michelle Kaufmann, on board from the beginning. Attia may have been crucial to the initial vision — or, more likely, crucial to convincing Google brass to fund the project — but the final product seems to have expanded beyond the work of designing buildings. Like any speculative startup project, Genie had to be more agile than that, grasping for a way to translate good tools and a disruptable industry into a workable business model.The evolution of Project Genie may have also put it at odds with the rest of Google X. After five months, Genie was turning into a suite of market-oriented software tools, organizing information for architects and developers rather than shaping the buildings themselves. Meanwhile, Google X seemed increasingly interested in ambitious hardware projects like self-driving cars and Google Glass, which may have left the software-oriented Genie as the odd man out. It's unclear exactly how the decision was made, but as 2011 drew to a close, it became clear Genie's days at Google X were numbered. According to the complaint, Astro Teller sent Attia an email on December 7th to let him know the project was finished. "I'm very sorry Genie will end," Teller said. "It would have been a great thing to make for the world."But it wasn't entirely the end. Genie wasn't the moonshot hardware project that Google X wanted, but it could still make for a viable business. Chim began drafting a business plan and meeting with investors, hoping to keep the project alive. Attia seems to have been cut out of those plans from the beginning, leading to some awkward moments as Google X's involvement in the project wound down. The group worked in an open office with glass-walled meeting rooms, and Attia describes returning to the office early one day, only to find the rest of the group in an unscheduled meeting. When he walked in to see what was happening, he was met with awkward silence. "Everybody abruptly stopped talking and exchanged glances with each other for what seemed to be a couple of minutes before Chim called the meeting off," Attia says."It would have been a great thing to make for the world."The signs were clear enough. In a phone call from Thrun the day before New Year's Eve, Attia got official word that the project was continuing without him. "Genie is spinning out, it's spinning out without you unfortunately, and that is that," Thrun told him. "It's a miserable situation…but there is nothing I can do about it."The new company was called Flux Factory, with Chim as CEO and Teller serving on the board. By now its goal seemed distinct from what Engineered Architecture offered. Flux's first product focused on gathering information about zoning and local ordinances, a completely different task from the modular design system described in the Engineered Architecture documents. Attia's scheme was a system for designing buildings, but Flux seems to be design-agnostic, creating tools that can be useful no matter how the architect approaches his craft. In an interview in November, Chim described Flux as providing decision support for developers, "computing key metrics such as construction cost and life-cycle operating cost in near real time."But Attia isn't convinced the projects are all that different. When I asked what elements of Engineered Architecture he saw in Flux, Attia’s reply (through his counsel) was simple: "Everything. Nothing was left behind. Nothing was added. Nothing was changed. Every specific aspect of Engineered Architecture is included in the Google/Flux presentations."Flux Metro's first demo, released in October In the years since, Attia seems to have given up the dream of a software-powered architecture system. In 2013, he was interviewed by the Israeli paper Globes, accusing Google X of stealing his life's work, but has kept quiet since then. Max Sound, a streaming audio company, bought the rights from Attia to protect Engineered Architecture’s technology in 2014, and is filing the suit on his behalf. Max Sound has multiple pending patent suits against Google, and in December, they offered to bankroll any credible IP claims against the search giant, claiming the sheer size of the web giant had convinced many smaller companies to avoid litigation. "We are interested in hearing more from other companies in similar circumstances," the Max Sound CEO said in a statement. But while Attia’s lawsuit may be a result of Max Sound’s thirst for litigation, his gripes against Google go back much further. Most of the significant facts of his case were laid out in the Globes interview, months before he connected with Max Sound.In the three years since the end of Project Genie, Google X has spun off more ideas into standalone Google projects, from Google Brain's AI research to Google Glass's new consumer version. As those projects have spun out, X has tackled even more ambitious schemes, building self-flying drones and Wi-Fi balloons. But Genie is still the only project to spin off into a standalone business.In the meantime, Flux is focused on the usual worries of an ambitious but cash-strapped startup. Their first product, Flux Metro, launched in October. It's an urban planning tool, aggregating and visualizing the local government's claim to any future buildings on a given plot of land. It’s planned as just the first of many products. Construction is a billion-dollar industry, and the company says Flux can have just as big an impact as higher-profile Google projects like Loon or Glass — that is, once the legal woes are sorted out. "We’re busy building much needed collaboration infrastructure for the construction industry," a company representative told The Verge, "and have no additional comments at this time."
      Microsoft is planning to open up its Xbox One apps platform in a big way this summer. While the software maker has remained consistently quiet around its timing for cross-platform (universal) apps running on its gaming console, sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the company will start to allow more and more apps on the Xbox One by the end of the year. Microsoft is planning to detail its plans fully at the company’s Build developer conference in April, but we understand they’ll involve allowing developers to turn retail Xbox One units into developer kits. Apps will be able to play music in the backgroundMicrosoft will also publish an SDK preview in May alongside the retail to dev kit switch, and both will be available publicly for developers to start creating apps in the summer timeframe. Microsoft currently restricts Xbox One app development to a small group of app developers, and this new program will open this up to everyone. Developers will also be able to use beta apps to test them with the community, and apps will finally be able to run in the background allowing third-party music apps to continue outputting music while a game is being played.Questions remain over the role of Kinect in Xbox One app development. Microsoft recently allowed Xbox One developers to access Kinect, but some developers report, anonymously, that performance has been disappointing. It’s not clear how Microsoft plans to support Kinect with universal apps.  Existing Xbox One apps will continue to run on the console, but Microsoft is planning to switch over to universal apps in November. The switch means developers will be able to submit and publish apps in November, and they’ll need to be built on the new universal apps SDK. Windows 10 will arrive on the Xbox One later this year to support these new apps, and Microsoft is slowly moving its approval and store policies to a pace that will allow developers to submit apps to Xbox One in a similar way to the existing Windows Store. This will allow a lot more apps to arrive on the Xbox One this November.
      Microsoft is bringing its Cortana digital assistant to Office. The software giant is currently testing a "Work Assistant" app that’s designed to use Cortana to open, edit, and share documents using voice commands and Cortana. Microsoft’s initial app is just a prototype right now, but sources familiar with the company’s plans tell The Verge that the intention is to integrate Cortana into Office across mobile and desktop platforms soon.Cortana will make its way to iOS and Android eventuallyThat could see Cortana arrive on iOS and Android in future, or at least basic features that are powered by Microsoft’s digital assistant. Given Microsoft’s recent launches of Office for iOS and Android, and a continued focus on making its services and apps available across all platforms, it shouldn’t be surprising that Cortana will eventually make the leap.&ampnbspBusiness Insider reported in November that Microsoft’s Julie Larson-Green confirmed Cortana will make its way to other operating systems, and Office integration is part of a number of plans for the digital assistant.A digital assistant returning to Microsoft Office will bring back memories of the annoying Clippy assistant from the '90s days of the company’s productivity software. While Clippy was more of a glorified help tool that popped up randomly when you were authoring documents, Cortana is subtle and actually helpful. Microsoft has been continually improving Cortana over recent months, even&ampnbspintegrating it into Windows 10 and the new Spartan browser. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella often refers to Cortana as an example of the types of apps and services the company will deliver in the future.
      Twitter CEO Dick Costolo is taking personal responsibility for his platform's chronic problems with harassment and abuse, telling employees that he is embarrassed for the company's failures and would soon be taking stronger action to eliminate trolls. He said problems with trolls are driving away the company's users. "We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years," Costolo wrote in an internal memo obtained by The Verge. "It's no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day. We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day." "It's nobody's fault but mine."Costolo's comments came in response to a question on an internal forum about a recent story by Lindy West, a frequent target of harassment on Twitter. Among other things, West's tormentors created a Twitter account for her then recently deceased father and made cruel comments about her on the service West recently shared her story on&ampnbspThis American Life and The Guardian. On Twitter's forums, an employee asked whether anything could be done:On Mon, Feb 2, 2015 at 4:37 PM, Adrian Cole  wrote:A must read in its own right about cyberbullying. One section suggestsTwitter can just do more."I’m aware that Twitter is well within its rights to let its platform be used as a vehicle for sexist and racist harassment. But, as a private company – just like a comedian mulling over a rape joke, or a troll looking for a target for his anger – it could choose not to. As a collective of human beings, it could choose to be better."In response, Costolo made a frank acknowledgement of Twitter's slowness to adopt tools to combat trolls.On Mon, Feb 2, 2015 at 8:35 PM, Dick Costolo  wrote:We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years.

You'll have to scroll for awhile before you hit the end of tweets containing gendered insults, victim blaming, incitement to suicide, sexual violence, and rape and death threats. Sarkessian was a top target for Gamergate predators because of her criticism of the way women are portrayed in video games, and her post shows that the vile intimidation campaign against her continues unabated.Gamergate is only the latest and loudest example of harassment. Robin Williams' daughter,&ampnbspZelda Williams, left the service last August because of the disturbing images and attacks she received after her father's suicide.&ampnbspAdvocates have offered numerous suggestions for fixing the problem, including improving responsiveness to reports and better blocking tools.Twitter's fourth quarter earnings call is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.

      While Google and Apple have been getting the lion's share of attention for smartwatches lately, indie darling Pebble has been quietly soldiering on, improving its product and selling watches. In an exclusive interview, CEO Eric Migicovsky revealed that the company shipped its one millionth Pebble on December 31st of last year. That's more than double of what Pebble&ampnbspreported in March, indicating that&ampnbspprice cuts and new feature additions later in the year successfully boosted sales figures.Pebble's biggest and most visible competitor so far has been&ampnbspGoogle's Android Wear, which launched in the middle of 2014 and is found on devices from Motorola, Samsung, LG, Sony, and Asus. Google has yet to reveal how many Android Wear watches have been sold in the six months or so it has been on the market, so it is difficult to determine if the platform is a success or not. Samsung allegedly&ampnbspshipped 800,000 of its Galaxy Gear smartwatches back in 2013, but the company has been mum on more recent figures.The new software platform will be unlike anything before itAccording to Migicovsky, Pebble plans to carry its momentum through 2015 with new products and a new software platform that is unlike anything else used on smartwatches to date. While Google and Apple's smartwatches have been focused on app paradigms, similar to smartphones, Pebble's new software will apparently be quite different. "We’ve found a new framework to use as an interaction model on the watch," boasts Migicovsky, before adding that while apps will continue to exist on Pebble, they won't be the main focus of the platform. "It doesn't look like what we have today, and it doesn't look like what's on your smartphone," added Migicovsky. Following the launch of the&ampnbspPebble Steel in January, the company used 2014 as an "investment year," increasing its headcount from around 30 to over 100 and bringing aboard some of the&ampnbspwebOS TV design team from LG, many of whom have been tasked with building the new software platform.Pebble will need all the help from developers it can getThough Pebble has seen a good amount of success thus far, 2015 will most certainly present challenges for the company, most notably the launch of&ampnbspApple's Watch in April. Google has been&ampnbspquickly iterating on its Android Wear platform, as well, and its partners are likely to bring second- and third-generation Android Wear smartwatches to market this year. Pebble has had a lot of success garnering support from third-party developers, with activity doubling since September. The company launched a&ampnbspweb-based emulator just this month, which lets developers build and test apps without having to install any software on their computers. There are now 6,000 apps and watchfaces on the current platform, and Pebble says it has nearly 25,000 developers contributing worldwide. If Pebble is to continue standing its ground against Apple and Google, it will need all the help from those developers it can get.Migicovsky would not divulge further details on the company's hardware and software plans, telling us that we'll have to wait until later this year to see what the company has up its sleeve. The war for your wrist is just getting started, and 2015 is shaping up to see some intense battles go down. With 1 million sales under its belt and a new platform to ride on, Pebble is gearing up for the fight.
      There goes another one. AOL is shutting down The Unofficial Apple Weblog, better known as TUAW, sources familiar with the situation tell The Verge. The company — which is also shutting down its gaming site Joystiq — is in the midst of a major reorganization, and is cutting back on media properties it deems as underperforming. TUAW’s run comes to an end on February 2nd.TUAW comes to an end on February 2ndFounded just over 10 years ago in December 2004, TUAW was acquired by AOL in 2005 when it purchased Weblogs, Inc., alongside other influential sites including Autoblog, Joystiq, and Engadget. TUAW currently has 11 editorial staffers, according to its about page. AOL CEO Tim Armstrong forecasted these changes during an earnings call back in November, stating that the company would "simplify everything that can be simplified." Armstrong said AOL would try to increase growth and value from its content sites by "simplifying the portfolio of brands," while improving its video offerings, which has rapidly become the backbone of just about every new media company’s advertising strategy.In total, AOL will lay off around 150 people, according to&ampnbspTechCrunch. The site is also reporting that&ampnbspTUAW and&ampnbspJoystiq will be "folded" into&ampnbspEngadget, with&ampnbspJoystiq staying on as a separate channel,&ampnbspbut we've heard different. AOL will put the archives of TUAW on a subdomain of&ampnbspEngadget, but past receiving the same treatment,&ampnbspJoystiq won't be sticking around in any meaningful capacity. We've heard AOL may keep a couple writers to run the subdomain, but Joystiq as it currently stands will not continue.&ampnbspTechCrunch is also reporting that&ampnbspAOL Autos will be folded into&ampnbspAutoblog.AOL's most profitable division is led by dial-up internetAOL is also reorganizing its sales organization, according to sources familiar with the situation, and first reported by Recode. Currently, AOL’s most profitable division is its Membership Group, which includes its dial-up internet offerings (yes, it still exists) and pulled in $139.2 million in adjusted income in the third quarter.Right now AOL has three flagship content properties in The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and Engadget. TechCrunch, which originally reported the news of AOL’s restructuring, noted that tech and lifestyle sites would most likely be affected by the changes. AOL decided against selling TUAW, leaving open the possibility it could resurrect the site in the future. But for now, a team of writers and editors are out of jobs.Update: January 30th: 10:00AM: TechCrunch is reporting that in total AOL will lay off about 150 people as part of its reorganization. This article has been updated accordingly.
      Microsoft is planning to radically overhaul its web browser in Windows 10. Sources familiar with the company’s Windows plans tell The Verge that the new browser, codenamed Spartan, will include a host of new features not found in rival browsers. Chief among the plans for Spartan is new inking support that allows Windows 10 users to annotate a web page with a stylus and send the notes and annotations to a friend or colleague. The web note service will be powered by Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage, meaning notes will be stored on a copy of a web page that can be accessed by any browser across multiple platforms. As annotations are shared, multiple users can doodle on a web page and share edits and annotations between groups. Cortana is coming to your browserA second major feature for Spartan will be the integration of Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant. Microsoft is planning to use Cortana to surface information on flights, hotel bookings, package tracking, and other data within the traditional address bar. If you use Cortana to track a particular flight and start to search for "American Airlines" in the browser address bar, it will automatically display tracked flights and allow Spartan users to view the status of the flight directly. It’s a subtle addition, but you’ll also be able to access Cortana search directly from the new tab interface in Spartan. Cortana integration in the Spartan browser is planned to replace every instance of the existing Bing methods in Internet Explorer.Other features include a new way to group tabs together to declutter the occasionally messy interface of multiple browser tabs. Spartan will allow users to group tabs however they want, making it easier, for example, to split up personal tabs from work ones. Microsoft also originally planned to allow Spartan to support custom themes, but we understand the company has dropped this for the final new browser in Windows 10. Such support may arrive in future updates.Spartan will be a Windows Store app for regular updatesSpartan is designed to be a single browser across PCs, tablets, and phones. We’re told that Microsoft will make Spartan a Windows Store app, enabling the company to quickly and easily update the browser in future. ZDNet previously reported that Microsoft will continue to include Internet Explorer in Windows 10, and we understand this will be primarily for legacy compatibility reasons. Spartan is the main browser in Windows 10, and most users will be accessing the web using it. While Spartan will be a Windows Store app, we understand Microsoft isn’t planning to make it a universal app initially. One version of Spartan will be available in the Store as a desktop app, and another as a modern app for tablets and phones. Both will be updated regularly with identical features.Microsoft is planning to keep the look and feel of Spartan very similar across phones, tablets, and PCs. The desktop version looks like a simplified version of Chrome, with a tabbed interface above the address bar, alongside options to go back, forward, and refresh a page. It’s all designed to look lightweight, without the bloat typically associated with older versions of Internet Explorer. While the Spartan name is a codename, it’s not clear if Microsoft plans to continue the Internet Explorer branding with its new browser. That naming and other features of Spartan could play a part in Microsoft’s Windows 10 event on January 21st. Microsoft is planning to detail the consumer features of Windows 10 at its press event later this month, including its phone and tablet features.We reached out to Microsoft for comment on its Windows 10 browser plans, but a spokesperson says the company has "nothing to share."Verge Video from CES 2015: First Look at Dell's XPS 13 Laptop
      .badge-ces{position:relative top:-103px margin:0px!importantpadding:0px!importantheight:0px!important} .m-article__entry {margin-top:0px!importantpadding:0px!important} CES 2015 has given us a deluge of new HomeKit announcements. Thus far, we’ve seen several smart outlets, a garage door opener, light bulb adapters, a door lock, and a power strip from vendors such as iDevices, iHome, GridConnect, Chamberlain, Schlage, and Incipio. Elgato announced an entire range of HomeKit sensors while Insteon introduced a full-on hub that bridges HomeKit-compatible devices with Insteon’s vast catalog of otherwise incompatible smart home accessories.Each new Wi-Fi device also shares one common trait: an Apple TV is required if you want to control them with Siri while away from home.Apple is not positioning its little hobby device as a home automation hubSo, while commands like "Siri, turn off the lights in the living room" will always work while connected to your home Wi-Fi network, they won’t from the airport unless you have an Apple TV. But that’s it — you can still switch off the lights with an app, no Apple TV required. This behavior has been confirmed by a source close to HomeKit’s development as well as two launch partners who wish to remain anonymous. Only third-generation or later Apple TVs running software 7.0 or later will support HomeKit.AppleInsider reported back in October that Apple TV Software beta 2 included support for testing HomeKit with iOS apps. While that would seemingly suggest a prominent role for Apple TV, we’ve been reliably informed that Apple is not positioning its little hobby device as a home automation hub. It's not something you need to buy if you want a HomeKit automated home, but if you have one then you get the additional feature of remote Siri commands.  Here at CES we’ve seen a wide variety of HomeKit-compatible controllers of variable quality. Demonstrations ran fine for the most part: lights turned on, power strips popped to life, and fans blew. But any deviation from the script risked crashes, lockups, and embarrassment in front of a throng of eager onlookers."It isn’t fully baked yet," said one HomeKit partner looking wistfully at an unresponsive light bulb. "Apple still has work to do.""It isn’t fully baked yet."One "demonstration" consisted of a product manager swiping through a stack of gallery images while holding a device labeled "not working."If Apple had its way, none of the dozen or so HomeKit devices would have been at CES since none of them are MFI (Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad) certified. In fact, the licensing program for HomeKit devices is just getting started, we’ve been told.HomeKit is clearly a work in progress. That’s why HomeKit partners only announced vague timelines for their respective releases. While some companies are hoping to release in Q1, other more cautious partners are hedging with a Q2 date. "We’ll put our products up for sale just as soon as Apple gets its act together," said one partner.Regardless, the HomeKit ecosystem is starting to look complete enough for most home automation needs. It might only be on paper for now, but the entrenched Z-Wave and Zigbee incumbents would be wise not to bet against Apple.See all the latest CES 2015 news here ›h2.ces-promo a{  background: #fa4b2a  border-radius: 3px  padding: 5px 14px 0px  font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,Helvetica,sans-serif  text-transform: uppercase  font-weight: normal  font-size: 30px  text-align:center  display:inline-block  margin:0px auto  color: #fff}  h2.ces-promo a:hover {      background:#bf2a0d      color:#fff      text-decoration:none    }}
      When Secret launched in February, it quickly became the most talked-about new social network in Silicon Valley. Like other ‘"anonymish" social networks, it offers a compelling mix of sex, drugs, and intrigue. But Secret goes a step further by connecting to your phone’s address book, then showing you your friends’ posts without revealing which friend said them. Several news stories broke first on Secret, fueling buzz that led the app to be downloaded more than 15 million times in 10 months. It hit No. 1 in the App Store in seven different countries.But in recent months, Secret has lost some of its initial power. The number of posts from friends in my feed slowed to a trickle, and Secret is no longer among the top 1,500 apps, according to App Annie. But as activity in the app slowed, Secret co-founders David Byttow and Chrys Bader were working on the second version of the service — and it might be the thing that brings Secret back to life. A faster, more text-based version of the service Secret 2.0 for iPhone and Android is a faster, more text-based version of the service that puts a new emphasis on chat. Gone are the slow-loading square photos overlaid with words in their place is a Twitter-like feed with snippets of text. You can still add a photo to your post, but it appears in a circular thumbnail next to the text. To view it you press and hold the image, and the picture pops up in full-screen mode for as long as you hold it, much as it would in Snapchat. "We still believe great ideas can come from anywhere," Byttow says. "It’s more important what is said than who said it. Our goal is to facilitate conversation — either in a physical location, or socially, with your friends."About conversation: Secret now enables private, one-on-one messaging between users. While you can still leave public comments on a secret, tapping on a user’s avatar will now let you contact the author of a post directly. Each chat gets a random label, like "Hidden Village" or "Magical Theater," to help you distinguish them from one another. (Each user also gets a randomly generated avatar, as before.) The conversations are ephemeral — they delete themselves after about a day of inactivity. But it feels more like instant messaging than trading emails Secret alerts you when someone begins typing in response to one of your private messages, and highlights their avatar when they are present in the chat. (You can also block or mute people you don't want to talk to.)  The absence of a private chat feature had led to difficult workarounds for Secret users who wanted to connect through the app: creating one-off Gmail accounts and leaving the address in the comments, say, or using Anonyfish, a third-party service built for the express purpose of letting Secret users chat. (Its future after today’s launch is unclear, though its founder has said he plans to integrate it with other services.)Secret is also making a major change to how you can share. Before, every post was broadcast to the entire Secret network, then filtered into "friend" and "explore" feeds. Now you see at least two feeds: secrets from your friends, and secrets from your city or school. In an important change, you can choose to share to your location rather than to your friends. Secret says it supports "thousands" of locations, including many colleges and universities in addition to cities. (If you work for one of the handful of companies that uses Secret, and you have verified your employment through an email address, you’ll see a feed for that as well.)Encouraging you to share moreIf the changes have a common goal, it’s encouraging people to share more, both by making the app easier to use, and by making its users more comfortable about posting. "We just believe that ideas should be discussed openly — and social networks today make that really hard," Bader says. "We believe that no one should ever have to feel alone — and should be able to put themselves out there, even if they feel like they’re not in the majority." The location-based feed lets you post to your location without worrying that your friends will recognize you by identifying details your post will be labeled only with your location.Rise of the anonymousSocial networks that cloak identity have never been more popular — or more highly valued. Yik Yak, an anonymous network modeled on bulletin boards, was valued at up to $400 million this year after becoming popular at schools. (The new Secret design has clear similarities to Yik Yak, which also has a text-based feed and emphasizes location.) Whisper, which has focused on sharing its anonymous posts with media companies, is reportedly valued at closer to $200 million.And yet like so many anonymity-focused apps before them, they have been dogged by controversy. Yik Yak has been criticized for enabling bullying and bomb threats. And Whisper found itself embroiled in scandal after The Guardian reported that the company is secretly tracking users. It suspended its editorial team nearly two months ago pending an investigation the company did not respond when The Verge asked for an update on its progress.To its credit, Secret has mostly avoided troubles like these. The company has invested heavily in moderation, hiring top executives from Facebook to lead its team, and took steps to prevent users from naming individuals in posts. But it's also true that getting rid of people's names in Secret that many people stopped using it. If they're concerned about this, the founders don't show it. "Everything we should do should allow for people to feel more comfortable posting," Bader says.  And yet you can’t deny that posts about individuals were one of the things that made Secret so compelling in the first place. Absent gossip, Secret can start to feel like a stream of Successories posters. "Feels better after a nice chat with an old friend," read a post in my feed this week. And yet, anecdotally at least, gossip also helped to drive people away from Secret. There’s an ick factor to obsessively checking an app to see which companies are in flames, which executives are getting fired, and so on. Thanks to Secret, you can read up on local gossip — but should you?There are a few more significant updates in the app. Most notably, you can no longer disassociate yourself from all your public posts with a single click those are associated with the phone number you use to log in. (There are legitimate privacy concerns about having your posts linked to your phone number, but it seems like it could also encourage good behavior.) The upside of a persistent account is that you can now view all of your posts in a single place, which was impossible before, and delete any of them that you wish to. You can also browse the app without signing in with a phone number, if you like. And there’s a nice feature for anyone whose secrets ever went viral: the app now shows you a running total of how many hearts your combined posts have received.The web version of Secret will disappearMeanwhile, Secret has become less of a media product — less like Whisper, in other words. The company plans to eliminate the web version of Secret, where it hosted collections of popular posts. And there are no longer permalinks for posts that you can share to the web.The company continues to experiment with "Secret for Work," its corporate product. (You verify where you work with an email, and then you can participate.) Dens are actively used at companies including Google and Facebook, where more than 2,000 employees use Secret to talk about company issues and share inside jokes. So far, it’s all free — like most young social networks, Secret isn’t yet talking about how it will make money. But Byttow says he is impressed with Snapchat, which for now is putting ads only in its sponsored stories feed.Secret’s quick rise and sudden slowing of its feed led some to write it off too quickly. (Business Insider somewhat hilariously put the company in a list of "startup darlings that fell off the map in 2014" — which, again, was the year that Secret attracted its first 15 million users.) The new version is faster, more fluid, and feels closer to what its founders set out to build. "Secret should be like a movie," Bader says. "There are sad parts, stressful parts, happy parts. It’s got the full gamut of emotions." The new version of the app is good enough to warrant a second look. The question is how many of the Secret users who come back will stay there.
  BuzzFeed announced today that it’s acquiring the talent team behind mobile app developer Hyper IQ, a significant investment in building native apps for a publisher that’s traditionally been web- and social-first.That’s a big tech story, and I spent an hour talking to BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti about the media business, what technology actually helps BuzzFeed do, and what’s next for a company he says was a “cat site” three years ago.Nilay Patel: It sounds like you have some pretty exciting tech news going on.Jonah Peretti: I think that one of the interesting things about all the stuff we do in tech is that in general technology is harder for people to understand. Some of the stuff that I'm most excited about I don't get a chance to talk about as much. It seems exciting to me and is probably interesting to readers of The Verge, but there are a lot of people who love BuzzFeed for entertainment and news and how it gets to them isn't really as exciting as what is getting to them.Obviously we have a very big tech audience at The Verge, but I spent six months earlier this year working on the Vox.com team, and it was actually really interesting for me to step back and watch how our publishing platform helped that team scale so fast and hit a different big audience. We think about our platform so much that it almost circles back around to taking it for granted, and I suspect that that is true at BuzzFeed as well."There also are other things where technology doesn't recede to the background."Well, there's certain technology that you want to have disappear so it makes things faster and easier. Ev Williams likes to talk about technology that lets you skip a step — something took five steps now takes four steps. The benefit is something that isn't there. Then there also are other things where technology doesn't recede to the background, like a lot of the stuff we do with new post formats or slide-y things or quizzes or rubable GIFs. That’s all more in the category of fun technology that you get to play with.And now you’re buying a company to help you build native apps?Yes. Hyper IQ is based in Minneapolis, and it's a pretty exciting opportunity for us to continue to expand our tech team. As we get bigger, we've expanded the company to a lot of different cities around the world now. There was a period where that was frustrating, because we had everyone all in one office, and then we didn't, and now it's moved to another mode. We have a network forming, we have offices with critical mass that can build parts of what we're doing. We're doing so much more than we've ever done before, and there's nice big meaty things for people to work on. We'll grow to 30 people in Minneapolis, and this acquisition is the first step.How many other cities are you in?We're in, let's see… we're in London and Berlin, and Sydney, and DC. We're opening up in San Francisco right now. Sao Paulo, in Brazil. It's getting up there.Hyper IQ has been building your app thus far?We have a larger team in New York that's working on the apps, but [Hyper IQ] has been working with us. Part of the reason we wanted to acquire the company is that they've done such great work.Maybe this is a question that only a media nerd asks a media nerd, but it seems like a great deal of your investment in technology so far has been at the platform level and for content creation, while distribution has all been about making things really sharable and really great so people will share them. But buying a company to make a native app is a distribution side move. A native app puts your icon next to the Facebook icon on my phone. How do you think about that relationship?I think that things have really evolved fairly quickly. I think the classic model of a media company is that you have content and you have distribution, and usually they're pretty separate. One company makes content, another company does distribution, and they often have a deal, a partnership, to distribute the content.BuzzFeed has invested in a model that's more vertically integrated. We're building the technology and the site and the CMS, and also the brand and the content, and building this full-stack startup. What we're seeing now is that's become more complicated. You're starting to see more network-integrated companies — we have teams that are making great news, and entertainment, and lifestyle content. We break that up into News, Buzz, Life, and then video. That content is part of a vertically integrated site that lives on the web. And that same content is going to an app. And to native content formats on Facebook, on YouTube, on other platforms.And technology — I'm sort of describing a diagram in my head — technology is important at every single level. Technology is important for how you create the content: do you have tools to build games or quizzes or beautifully laid out longform articles or breaking news? The way the CMS works and the way that the format works is driven by technology, so having great technology for making content is important."Technology is important at every single level."Then having great technology for distributing content on your own site matters. How do you recommend articles? What you show in the thumbnails, what kind of recommendation system do you have? Then technology really adds to distribution on the other side — do you have a good way of tracking which of your YouTube videos are getting lots of views, and using that data to inspire teams to make things that will connect with the audience?So I think that when you look at the role of technology it's everywhere in this network-integrated model. You have content creation requiring or benefiting from technology, you have content on your own site and owned and operated properties, apps, and websites that benefit from technology, and then you have technology that is even really important when you're publishing to other platforms because there's APIs and ways of tracking what's happening to other platforms and understanding what that means on other platforms.That makes sense, but let me pull this out. This sounds like ‘BuzzFeed Everywhere.' You're pushing BuzzFeed content into every platform and you're making kind of every bet. You're making a web bet, you're making a ‘social-content-driving-back-to-your-website' bet, you're making a ‘we're putting an app on your homescreen' bet. Where does BuzzFeed live? Where do you think of as BuzzFeed's canonical home?I think it's becoming much more distributed. And people are still figuring out what that means.I think mobile apps are increasingly important to us. We care most about what’s best for consumers, so it's not like we have an ideological or religious view on where content should live. Should it be a native app, or on the web, or mobile web? It really should be dictated by what's best for the consumer and what's best long-term for building a media company that can thrive with how people are consuming media today instead of how they consumed media 10 years ago.When you think through that lens, things are becoming much more distributed. Our video business was over 800 million video views last month, we're on pace to do even more this month, and it's very distributed across other platforms. Our videos are on Facebook, on YouTube, on AOL, and on Yahoo. But we're able to use one dashboard to track how those videos are doing on all different platforms, and Ze Frank's video team in LA is able to learn from all of that data."It doesn't matter where the content lives, but it does matter that you're able to get some knowledge and learning from it."So the key for us is publishing to wherever consumers really want to engage with our content — but can we get data and knowledge back so we can learn and get better? Also we should get money back, which allows us to fund doing more of it. If you have that, it doesn't matter where the content lives, but it does matter that you're able to get some knowledge and learning from it. That's the thing that traditional media sort of lacks. It’s a huge advantage for a tech-oriented media company that’s on a digital platform.If you're a traditional production company and you make a television show, you sell it to a network, and you get Nielsen ratings back. You don't really know much about which parts of your show people liked or didn't like, or what people thought about it. It's really hard to link producing content to a real relationship with your audience. I think with the technology base underneath everything we do, we're able to get knowledge back and have a closer relationship with our audience and serve the consumer better. That matters to us more than asking if the content is on mobile web or in a native app, or if it lives on our own properties or on some other property.So the news here is Hyper IQ. When you're thinking about BuzzFeed as distributed on every platform, what led you to actually buy the shop that's helping you build the native app?Native apps are extremely fast, and they are a great way to get to news and entertainment and video. Native apps can be a really great experience. The other reason we're really excited about native apps is that you can get data back in a really rich way about how people are engaging with your content. So that helps us make better stuff and be engaged with our audience. So that's a big reason."Minneapolis is an underrated tech town."[Hyper IQ] has really talented engineers who are doing great work, located in a city where there’s a lot of great engineering talent. We think that we can provide really great opportunities for them to do really interesting work that they might not be able to do or find elsewhere. I think Minneapolis is an underrated tech town. There's a lot of really great engineers there.The other thing we see, and lots of publishers see, is that the users of our mobile apps share at a higher rate. They visit more frequently and read more. It's also a place where it makes lots of sense for us to invest.The Verge used to have an app, and we actually just shut it down in favor of responsive web. One of the reasons was that we weren't able to innovate as fast as we were on the web. How are you going to manage that as you're more native?So this is a real challenge.If you come up with web development as your core, you get used to the ability to deploy multiple times a day, to test features with 5 percent of your audience, and only rolling out to your audience once you see that it works well. A lot of agile development and flexible testing is much harder to do in an app environment. It's harder to do for technical reasons, it's harder to do because of app store approval, and pushing your app is really a big deal. Pushing a deploy to the Buzzfeed.com website is a trivial thing that really any engineer is able to do because we've built all kinds of tools to make deployment easier on web.  That's great, because you can do more faster and have shorter loops and shorter cycles of development.But mobile apps are somewhere between the web and old-school desktop software development, where there’s the big release once a year and the patch to fix bugs. So it is a challenge, and that's primarily why we wanted to hire 30 people in Minneapolis and many more than that in New York and LA and San Francisco and other places. The tech team is over 110 people now, and we want to go to 250 people by the end of next year.It's a big investment to develop for all the different platforms that are out there. We feel that it's worth it. We won't be able to develop as quickly as we do on the web and have as short a dev cycle, but you can start to figure out ways. It's a kind of different mindset of how you build things — if you have a big enough team you can start to really push features that aren't even possible to the web, because they're native."Pushing a deploy to the Buzzfeed.com website is a trivial thing that really any engineer is able to do."When you look at our app now, we spent really a year working on underlying architecture and making sure that it loaded quickly, it didn't crash, and it was designed in such a way that we could build some cool features. It would seem crazy to spend that amount of time on the web. Now we're ready to start building some of the cool features that will be more noticeable. We went from having an app that crashed a lot at the beginning of the year to having an app that was in the Best Apps of the Year on the Android and iOS App Stores.So it is a challenging thing, and my natural impatience which stems from being used to the web is definitely [tried] sometimes. Sometime I want to be able to think of an idea, test it a week later with a small percentage of the users, see if it works, and then roll it out. And [with an app] you have to think much more strategically and build things on longer cycles that you know or hope will have a bigger impact. So you're doing things, you're taking longer strides, which can be frustrating or scary.Let me get back to the idea of putting an icon on the home screen. It's something I think about a lot. You’re putting an icon next to Facebook. Once you start delivering better and better experiences in your native app, especially for something like video where the best experience is native, how do you think about competing with Facebook which drives all of the traffic to your other media types?Well, it's really similar to BuzzFeed's homepage. It's not that it's competing with Facebook, it's that we have a dedicated audience that comes to BuzzFeed. Whether they come to our app or our homepage, they're the ones who initially share things to Facebook. Our content wouldn't even be on Facebook if it wasn't for people who thought it was worth sharing with their friends. The app really will be a smaller number of visitors, but they'll be the ones with the biggest influence on what BuzzFeed stories initially are getting shared.I see it as part of a larger ecosystem of content discovery, where apps created by media companies are actually pretty important because there's a place people can discover content they think is worth spreading across a social network. So in a way our app is a service to allow people to find stuff that they want to share into other services.I spend a lot of time thinking about homepages, because we have a big one. The Verge is older in that way. How big is the BuzzFeed homepage? Do you guys spend a lot of time thinking about it? How do you think about programming the first screen of the app?So we're actually kind of deep in this right now. Part of adding additional tech resources is really building collaboration between engineers and editorial people. That practice is core to what we do on the web — there's folks on the engineering team working closely with editorial people, and they go back and forth, and they develop ideas. It's kind of a rare thing to have a tech team at our scale that also gets to work with the people making the content. We can point out a new format that inspires an editor to make something, or an editor has an idea that's inspired by new technology, or there are new ways to display content. That's something that we want to also do with apps. And we haven't done it on the same level with apps. Sometimes the app is getting programmed by what's happening on the web, and that doesn't really make sense. People visit the BuzzFeed app many times a day more than the average person is looking at the homepage of the site. So it’s something that we're pretty excited about. We've got some star editors and star developers working together to define how to program the front page of an app, and how much personalization to have, and how to say this is important news. All that has to be a real partnership between great editors and great developers.So there’s personalization that happens in your app?There is some light personalization that we played with in an earlier version of the app, where you would choose what you liked and didn't like. Now we're working on some subtler, more automatic personalization. Apps definitely lend themselves to personalization in a way that is easier than the web — even if you don't have a logged-in user, if they're using the app, you have a sense of the person. But I don't think we want necessarily want [the app] personalized. You probably do if you’re Facebook or Twitter, but if you're a news organization, you also want to sometimes take an editorial stance where you tell people something because it's important.Once you go down the road of having a native app, having the content right there, having some offline capability, and then doing some algorithmic personalization based on interests, you’re basically creating the next news feed, right? I hate to keep hammering in the idea that you're competing with Facebook, but it's an easy thing to draw the broad strokes of.We don't really have any plans to do personalization on that level. We will always have a weird, eclectic mix of things that we're creating. We don't have a universe of a kajillion stories to personalize for each individual person. We have the stuff we're making, and even though we have a large editorial team and reporters around the world, and all kinds of great content, it's still content being made by one organization, and not the entire world."It’s like, say you hate cute kittens because you're a monster with no empathy. So you don't see any cute animal content."The primary way that people get a personalized content experience with BuzzFeed content is the Facebook newsfeed or their Twitter feed or Pinterest or YouTube. But when you come to BuzzFeed, directly to our homepage or our app, the kind of personalization we would want is much lighter than that. It’s like, say you hate cute kittens because you're a monster with no empathy. So you don't see any cute animal content. Or you don't like sports, or you love sports, you have a certain category. Some people really care about what's up with Taylor Swift and the latest in celebrity stuff. Other people find celebrity news enraging. We realize that there are some people who may want a hard news experience and some people who may want mostly video and love all the stuff we're doing with video, and there's some people who will like the mix of stuff but they don't want X, Y, or Z, or they want a little more of A, B, or C. That's the kind of personalization that makes sense for us.The heavyweight personalization that social networks do either through something like the follow graph on Twitter or through more algorithmic approach on Facebook is designed to give people the stuff that they want. What we're focused on is giving people stuff that they think is worth sharing with other people. We want the stories we're doing to have the biggest possible impact. So if we do personalization, it would be more of a personalization about what you’re most likely to share or discuss with your friends.You can do video much better in the native app. Is that going to be an immediate focus, or is that going to be something that you build towards?Well, our video business is pretty distributed. We’re getting the native video viewing experience by distributing our video into other native players. So we could have said we're really investing heavily in video, let's put this all in our own player, and let’s make people use that player. The problem is that even if we had an iOS native player and experience in our app, our video wouldn’t be be native in Facebook's app. Right?We want our video to be native when people open in Facebook's app, because it will have the silent autoplay and all those things that are native to that environment. So, it's not this crucial, pressing thing where people will not be able to watch BuzzFeed video or that people won't have a good experience watching BuzzFeed video because it's mobile web, because most of the views now aren't happening in mobile web. They're happening in native players of other sites where we take our video, or other services where we take our video.Sure, but I mean, that raises a pretty obvious question of how well can you monetize your video when you're distributing views across a million different players?I mean, our video business is in the hyper-growth stage. There's about 150 people in a four-acre studio lot in Los Angeles that Ze Frank runs. We've built it essentially as a break-even business while in hyper-growth mode. So, we probably should be investing more in it, but we make branded video. Things like Dear Kitten, which we made for Purina, is a great piece of content that’s also an advertisement for cat food. It works as content and also has amazing effects on purchase intent. And we can take what we know about making great video and make a branded version of that video, and use that as a way of monetizing. And then we also have all of the monetization that is part of YouTube, which is kind of light monetization but with the amount of views we have, it can actually add up to something pretty significant."Our video business is in the hyper-growth stage."Video is really interesting to me. One thing I think about the multiplier effect of technology. The way you scale and the way we scale is that our platforms allow us to scale for cheap or free. You can add one more reader for free. And if you're really good, the platforms enable you to create content at a lower cost as well, because it's easier to make one more quiz or the format lends itself to something more popular. You can get more efficiency out of one more employee. That is not true right now with our platform, I’ll be honest, or I'm guessing your platform when it comes to video creation. Because you make a CMS that enables you to write or publish a quiz really fast, but you don't make a video editing software that allows you to make animated explainers for YouTube the way that After Effects lets you do it. So you are constrained by the old way, and technology doesn't provide nearly as much of a multiple in video.How are you attacking that problem? I see that as a big problem for every technology company that wants to go into video, and I say that as a man who works at a technology company that invests in video. I'm very curious about this answer.Well, some of it is the reason we have that LA campus is that it allows us to build a set, and we have green screens and facilities. All of that is an upfront cost, and then the variable cost of making a video is actually very low because we have all of that in place. So it's not really of what you would think of as technology, but it's partly why the old studio lot model makes sense — you end up having the ability to make video at a lower cost because you have resources and facilities and talent all together in one place.Then all the data that you get back helps you learn which formats work, which actors work, which topics are people interested in, and that furthers creative development. You're not just outsourcing it to a production company — you actually have the people making the videos learning based on how the videos are being distributed. Then I think there are some technology factors where you build technology to help you syndicate video, to help you track it, help you understand potential technology benefits to make workflow faster, better, make it easier to translate videos.I think that usually there's ways to generate some advantages from technology or from organizational or operational initiatives, but it's more expensive to make video, and the cost of failure is higher, and the way video is shared is different, and it's all these things that make it challenging. It isn't it just any improvement based on technology and operations.I read a couple days ago Ben Smith saying that in three years he doesn't think BuzzFeed will exist in its current form. Can you tell me what Ben was talking about and what you think that means?He was talking about all the stuff we've been talking about. It's hard to predict three years out, so part of it was saying, "Who knows what'll happen in three years, what the web will be like in three years?" We've been based on a model of continual change. Three years ago, BuzzFeed had no reporters. Two years ago we had no video. One year ago we didn't have foreign correspondents around the world or an investigative team. Three years ago we were a cat site, an internet meme site. So a lot has changed in three years.It's an out-of-context quote — Ben was talking about the changes that have happened in three years. We went from the traditional media model of content and distribution to the vertically-integrated model of content distribution technology to the network-integrated model of technology helping at every level. Technology helping with content creation and then that content going on our platforms, distributed across the web, potentially going to traditional platforms like television or print. We don't really have plans to do any print."Three years ago we were a cat site."But there's a possibility of having something that you look at and think that this isn't a site, this is a global media company. It's not just a site, it's a whole process for distributing news, buzz, life, on the web, mobile, native apps, and it looks very different than it looks today.When you think about that process of going from one stage to another to landing at the network-distributed model, in terms of consumer experience, where does the technology have the most impact? Where's the place that you're delivering to them the best experience?So the media bundle, if it’s the newspaper, it lands on your doorstep, you go through it, and see all the different sections, and it’s the complete, canonical version.And I think what you see now is technology and engineering is having a bigger impact on what the bundle is. Instead of one bundle, we ended up with lots of bundles. We're some percentage of a Facebook newsfeed bundle, we're some percentage of Twitter's bundle, we're some percentage of Pinterest's bundle, and so there's all these personalized bundles that are being delivered by technology, and we're a part of it.And then when it comes to our app, and to our homepage and to our properties that we're developing, most of that is our content, so then the app becomes a bundle that is 80 percent BuzzFeed content. Maybe there's some other links or other content, but it's mostly our content. And so you end up with multiple bundles. Depending on who you ask you'll get a very different view of what BuzzFeed is.We’re moving a world where there will be multiple bundles, and that's why technology is so important, because engineers are able to understand this dynamic bundling, which is a different way of thinking about the media industry. They’re able to build better bundles. And brands will matter across this distributed landscape. BuzzFeed needs to stand for a certain kind of quality and sensibility — we need to make things that deserve to be in other people's bundles, and we'll have our own bundles that we create. Which is part of what the team in Minneapolis will build with the app they'll work on.Most of the media industry regards BuzzFeed's technology advantage as some sort of dark magic — a mixture of platform and social prowess that's terrifying for an older generation of media companies. And for good reason: they likely can't change their culture or develop their platforms fast enough to compete. But what scares BuzzFeed in the same way? What don't you guys understand?I don't understand the traditional media business, so the feeling is mutual! And it is still huge and powerful, in scale and especially revenue. We are very small compared to Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and the other big guys."It's not just a site, it's a whole process for distributing news."BuzzFeed excels when we can combine art and science. This is why we focus on platforms where creative people can try ideas, get feedback from the world, and use it to learn and get better everyday. This is why developing the technology for our own site and apps is so important to us and why we invest so much in data science. And it is also why we invest in platforms like Facebook and YouTube that give us data back to incorporate into our creative process.This isn't possible in print, broadcast, or traditional films which may be why the media industry is such a dysfunctional place. Executives make huge bets based on gut, it’s hugely expensive to take risks, and most projects fail. It’s enough to drive anyone a little crazy. I don't understand that world, and it scares me. And I also get scared whenever a tech platform wants to evolve to be more like cable TV or more like the media industry, by locking up the data and tightly controlling media consumption. In the long run, I think the platforms that share data with creators will win and so will the media companies that hire lots of great engineers to help make sense of that data and put it into action.
      HP threw a curveball when it announced a surprisingly good-looking smartwatch earlier this year, the Michael Bastian-designed Chronowing. It doesn't have the horsepower of an Android Wear device or the to-be-released Apple Watch, but the Chronowing still manages notifications from your phone, has a neat subdial that simulates an analog watch face, and — this is key — actually kind of looks like a real watch.But HP didn't make the Chronowing, it turns out. Multiple sources familiar with the relationship have confirmed that the manufacturer behind the timepiece is Meta, the Fossil spinoff that recently launched its own M1 line of smartwatches penned by former Vertu designer Frank Nuovo.The relatively low-resolution, monochrome square display format shared by the Chronowing and M1 is a strong hint of the shared DNA, but the real evidence lies on the Chronowing's back: the two devices share an FCC ID and connector style, a curved array of four pins unique to Meta. (You can see the back of the Chronowing in A Blog To Watch's review the back of the M1 is here.) Though the two products use different companion apps, there are obvious similarities between them.  The Meta M1.The HP watch may not be a huge seller — its pricing and limited retail distribution practically ensure that it won't be — but for Meta, the implications could be far bigger. The company could be taking a page from Fossil's playbook: though Fossil-branded watches constitute a substantial portion of the fashion accessory giant's bottom line, it also makes hundreds of millions of dollars from its white-label products sold under brands like Michael Kors, Diesel, Burberry, and Armani Exchange, among others. Without a broadly recognized brand of its own, Meta could make a business by offering its platform — a platform it's been working on for several years — to traditional watchmakers and luxury brands that don't have any smartwatch strategy in place.Granted, watchmakers don't need smartwatches to survive just yet Fossil itself had strong growth in its latest earnings report without a single smartwatch in its lineup. But low- to midrange brands that haven't started thinking about a strategy may start feeling pressure going into 2015, particularly in the shadow of the Apple Watch. (Premium brands likely won't feel much of anything, thanks to the unique motivations and deep pockets of their clientele.)Meta and HP declined to comment for this story.
      Microsoft is planning to detail the consumer features of Windows 10 at an event in January. While Microsoft will be present at the Consumer Electronics Show in early January, sources familiar with the company’s plans tell The Verge that Microsoft will hold a separate press event in late January to unveil the consumer preview of Windows 10. Microsoft previously promised "early 2015" for a discussion on consumer features, and it appears the company is on track.Microsoft’s first unveiling of Windows 10 was a small low-key event in San Francisco that lasted around an hour, but we’re told the company’s consumer feature unveiling will be more significant. Microsoft has a large number of features to discuss, including a new touch interface dubbed Continuum. The software giant will also detail its plans for Windows phones and tablets, and possibly dashboard updates for its Xbox One gaming console. Windows 10 is designed to run across multiple devices, including PCs, tablets, phones, and the Xbox One. We understand Microsoft will announce the details of its Windows 10 consumer event before the end of the year.
  Imagine you have an online service for chatting with friends, with somewhere in the neighborhood of 650 to 700 million monthly active users. Those users put up something like 2.5 billion pieces of discrete content every month: posts, photos, comments, and likes. That would be a pretty huge service, second only to Facebook itself in its sheer size and scope. You'd think the app for that service would be wildly popular. But you'd be wrong — because until now, that app didn't exist.The service, of course, is Facebook Groups, which will now get its own dedicated app on iOS and Android. And those eye-popping numbers are very real despite the fact that the majority of users have been digging through several layers of the "Big Blue" classic Facebook app to access Groups. "Groups are buried," says product manager Shirley Sun, echoing the same problem we heard from everybody on the Groups team. User experience researcher Loi Sessions Goulet pointed out that for people using messaging apps to communicate with small groups, “the main problem they were facing was disorganized conversation.” Instead of chat focused on simple topics that you can dip into when you want them, it’s a million conversations happening in real time. Groups could help with that, Facebook thought, but again, “the functionality was buried.”So the team excavated it. Today, Facebook is launching a separate Groups app.    If you're not familiar, Groups is Facebook's product that essentially replicates the traditional News Feed of photos, links, and status updates — but does it on a smaller scale. You can set up a small group that includes just your close friends, family, or softball team. Then that group sort of acts like a mini-Facebook, letting you post photos, comments, and other status updates. Instead of algorithms guessing which news story you're most likely to click on, you just see stuff from other people in the group. And when you post to a group, the privacy settings of your post are predetermined by the group's settings. Lastly, if you want to find groups that already exist for stuff you’re interested in, there’s a discover tab that shows the groups your friend network already uses.We've been using the app for a few days now and found it to be fast, fluid, intuitive, and surprisingly fun. That's not a huge surprise – it comes in part from Facebook's Creative Labs, which has been responsible for other polished Facebook apps like Paper and Slingshot. Animation on both Android and iOS is fluid and fast, the overall app layout is simple and direct, and functionality (including privacy settings) is easy to intuit just by poking around a bit. It's a great app.But Groups isn't meant to be a wild new endeavor for Facebook. As Sun put it, it's for "people who are already active today, and want to engage even more." She's basically right: Groups doesn't feel like something totally different from Facebook. In fact, it feels like what Facebook used to be. Using it feels like a throwback to the Facebook of old, back when the only thing you'd find in it was stuff from your friends and family. In the app, you get immediate access to the updates you actually want from your (actual) social networks.Will there be ads? Facebook’s not saying yet, but for now there aren’t, and that’s wonderful. As for the future, Sun tells us that when it was designing Groups, the team was "focused on experience without considering a monetization end goal."Groups will continue to exist inside the main Facebook appWhen Facebook broke out Messenger from the main app, it caused a hullabaloo because you couldn't access Messenger from the main Big Blue Facebook app anymore. Not so with Groups, which will continue to also live there, buried four interactions deep. But if you use groups, you can get to them faster now — you can even put a specific group directly on your iPhone or Android phone’s homescreen.  As an independent app, Groups also gives users more controls over their notifications: you can get everything immediately from your study group, but your keg party planning group photos can wait (or, more likely, vice versa). That kind of granular notification structure could make Groups useful in a business context — and in fact Facebook has been doing exactly that.Because it's private, you end up using Groups a little differently. It's a freer place to post photos for your friends and family, but Facebook envisions other uses, too. There are three privacy settings: public, closed, and secret — and each has simple explanations for what they mean. So when you create a group, you also choose the privacy settings. It's probably not enough for you to entrust your (ahem) most private photos to Facebook, but it is probably enough to trust that your unsexy vacation photos won't accidentally get posted publicly for everybody to see. You can also see little green indicators next to the group members that are online and using Facebook right now.Facebook offers some clues in how it hopes people will use groups the suggestions it gives you when you create a new one: clubs, sports teams, and even couples. On the extreme end of the spectrum, more than one person who worked on the Groups team was proud to say that over a quarter of the population on the island of Mauritius are part of a buying and selling group.    One option we expected to see more of, but didn't, was a default for businesses and companies. That's not just because rumors of a business-focused Facebook app have picked up recently, but also because Facebook itself basically runs on Groups. It has for some time now, to the point where lead engineer Dave Ferguson says that Facebook has shut down its main email listserv last month. Everybody just uses Groups for everything, he says, because "distribution email lists were pretty inadequate compared to groups." You can go through a longer history with Groups, and threads of conversations are broken out.An email-killing Yammer/Slack/Basecamp/Convo app designed explicitly for businesses may very well come in time, but theoretically Groups could be that app now for some people. For the rest of us, it's enough that this Groups app provides a nicer experience for those 700 million or so people who use it for their non-work groups. "People like their groups," Ferguson says, "let’s solve their top problems as step one."Groups is the furthest thing from flashy, and that's the point. If you're wondering what ever happened to the Facebook that helps you stay in touch with your friends and family, here it is, back again without the spammy top ten lists, viral content, or ads. It's Facebook with just your friends. Imagine that.Additional reporting by Ellis Hamburger
      Fitbit is preparing to launch three new fitness trackers in the coming weeks. Two of those will be the Charge and Charge HR. The Charge looks to be a revision of the Fitbit Force, which was pulled off the market after it caused bad skin reactions for some customers. Charge HR will offer a bit extra with the addition of PurePulse, the company's wrist-based heart rate monitoring system. But there's more: Fitbit has also been working on a third, flagship wearable for serious athletes. It's the Fitbit Surge.Apparently Fitbit thinks Surge is several steps beyond your average "wearable." The company refers to it as a "superwatch" according to marketing materials The Verge has received from a tipster. Set to be priced at $249, the Surge includes built-in GPS tracking — a big draw for runners — PurePulse heart rate monitoring, and promises to provide real time workout data for a variety of activities. You'll get stats on distance, pace, elevation climbed, heart rate intensity, and so on. Plus all the activity and sleep tracking you'd expectAnd since the company hopes you'll be wearing it constantly, the Surge will also carry over Fitbit's 24/7 activity tracking to make sure you're moving enough throughout the day. Some of those metrics include calories burned, floors climbed, and active minutes. There's sleep tracking too, which will monitor the quality of your night's rest and wake you up each morning with a vibrating alarm.Like competing fitness trackers, you'll be able to wirelessly sync all that data to Fitbit's app, where you can also log meal intake and earn badges for your progress in meeting health goals. Surge will offer your basic "smart" notifications for phone calls and texts, and you can also control music playback with the watch. But don't call it a smartwatch no one's going to be buying this as a replacement for Android Wear or the Apple Watch. When Surge eventually launches, it'll come in three colors: black, slate, and a more colorful tangerine option. Want the full details? Here's everything the marketing sheet tells us.GPS trackingGet distance, pace, and elevation climbed with built-in GPS, then review routes and split timesPurePulse heart rateContinuous, automatic wrist-based heart rate monitoring with no uncomfortable chest strapsMade for multi-sportRecord running, cross training, and cardio workouts, then see comprehensive workout summaries that include tailored metrics, workout intensity and calories burnedActivity trackingTrack heart rate, steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, floors climbed, and active minutesSmart notificationsSee call and text notifications on display and control music right from your wristDesigned for all-day wearSleek, comfortable wristband with customizable watch faces available in black, slate, and tangerine.Sleep quality + silent alarmMonitor how long and how well you sleep and wake with a silent vibrating alarmWireless syncing + online toolsSync stats wirelessly and automatically to your computer and to over 60 leading smartphones.

      Microsoft is busy preparing a "Windows Technical Preview" for later this month, but the software maker is also privately testing an "Office Technical Preview" for the next version of its popular Office suite. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s Office plans tell The Verge that the company has been distributing copies of a future version of Office to partners and testers recently, providing an early look at new features.While testing is in the early stages, we understand Microsoft is adding the "Tell Me" helper found in its Office Online apps to the desktop versions. Tell Me sits at the top of documents as a type of help and search tool. It’s similar in function to Clippy, providing a quick way to discover features and ask questions without digging into the vast help documentation found in Office. There’s no animated character like Clippy, just a simple bulb icon to indicate its presence in documents. Asking questions like "how do I insert images?" will bring up relevant features and additional help. It’s mainly a tool to help Office users discover the vast amount of features that are available across all the individual apps.   A new black theme was the number one request for Microsoft OfficeMicrosoft’s Office Ribbon is still present, and there are no major user interface changes just yet. Microsoft has, however, added a new black. We’re told that the black theme was the number one feature request for Office 2013 — likely because it existed in Office 2010 — and Microsoft is seeking feedback on its implementation to tweak any areas that are too bright. It’s an unusual look for Office, but if you’re used to regularly working in documents then it appears to be easier on the eyes than the white theme. The black theme isn’t default, it’s just an option for Office users alongside the light gray, dark gray, and white themes.Other new features include automatic image rotation, allowing Microsoft to use camera metadata to correctly position images in Office documents. Once pictures are inserted, Office will automatically rotate a picture to match the camera’s orientation, with options to manually rotate afterwards. Microsoft is also improving its Outlook email client with sync options to just download 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, or 14 days of email. In the existing version of Outlook you can only download a minimum of one month of email, so the new option will improve any space issues on Windows laptops and tablets with limited storage.The majority of Microsoft’s improvements in what is known as "Office 16" are fairly minor changes. This next version of Office should set the schedule and the ability for Microsoft to regularly update Office 365 with new features, improvements, and fixes. That was the promise of a subscription version of Office, and it appears Microsoft is planning to deliver that for its desktop users.
  The Android Wear that's shipping on the Motorola Moto 360, LG G Watch, and Samsung Gear Live is a far cry from where Google started when designers sat down to start sketching it out. "It was a long process of really trying to understand what people wanted from these kinds of devices," says David Singleton, Wear's director of engineering.On the heels of the 360's launch — the first round Android Wear device — Google gave us an exclusive peek at the concepts, mockups, and use cases that went...

      Uber is arming teams of independent contractors with burner phones and credit cards as part of its sophisticated effort to undermine Lyft and other competitors. Interviews with current and former contractors, along with internal documents obtained by The Verge, outline the company’s evolving methods. Using contractors it calls "brand ambassadors," Uber requests rides from Lyft and other competitors, recruits their drivers, and takes multiple precautions to avoid detection. The effort, which Uber appears to be rolling out nationally, has already resulted in thousands of canceled Lyft rides and made it more difficult for its rival to gain a foothold in new markets. Uber calls the program "SLOG," and it’s a previously unreported aspect of the company’s ruthless efforts to undermine its competitors. Together, the interviews and documents show the lengths to which Uber will go to halt its rivals’ momentum. The San Francisco startup has raised $1.5 billion in venture capital, giving it an enormous war chest with which to battle Lyft and others. While the company’s cutthroat nature is well documented, emails from Uber managers offer new insight into the shifting tactics it uses to siphon drivers away from competitors without getting caught. It also demonstrates the strong interest Uber has taken in crushing Lyft, its biggest rival in ridesharing, which is in the midst of a national expansion.After The Verge asked Uber for comment on its report, the company stalled for time until they could write this blog post introducing Operation SLOG to the world. "We never use marketing tactics that prevent a driver from making their living — and that includes never intentionally canceling rides," the company said.‘A special ongoing project’Earlier this month, CNN reported that Uber employees around the country ordered and then canceled 5,560 Lyft rides, according to an analysis by Lyft. (Lyft arrived at this figure by cross-referencing the phone numbers of users who tried to recruit Lyft drivers to Uber with users who had previously canceled rides.) Uber flatly denied trying to sabotage its competitor: "Lyft’s claims against Uber are baseless and simply untrue," the company said."Uber is flat-out lying to their customers."But one Uber contractor The Verge spoke with said Lyft’s complaint had merit. "What’s simply untrue is that not only does Uber know about this, they’re actively encouraging these actions day-to-day and, in doing so, are flat-out lying both to their customers, the media, and their investors," the contractor said. Until now, the canceled Lyft rides have been understood as a kind of prank call designed to keep competitors’ drivers off the road. But interviews and internal documents suggest another reason: Uber’s recruitment program has vastly increased in size and sophistication, and recruiters cancel rides in part to avoid detection by Lyft.The ground troops in Uber’s sabotage campaign are the company’s ambassadors, some of whom it hires through TargetCW, a San Diego-based employment agency. For the most part, ambassadors work at events or on college campuses, promoting Uber as a cheap and easy way of getting around town. The primary goal is to recruit riders, not drivers, and Uber calls the activity "slanging." But since at least mid-summer, some brand ambassadors in New York have been turning their talents against Lyft. Using Uber-provided iPhones and credit cards, the contractors hail rides, strike up conversations with their drivers, and attempt to sign them up before they arrive at their destination. (In other cities recruiters travel with "driver kits" that include iPhones and everything else a driver needs to get started on Uber ambassadors were told New York State does not allow this.) Compensation varies, but contractors can earn a $750 commission for successfully recruiting a single new driver to Uber, according to a contractor.Organizing a street teamAs Lyft has gotten better at sniffing out recruiters and banning them from the service, Uber has been forced to alter its tactics. In the run-up to Lyft’s high-profile launch last month in New York City, Uber organized a "street team" to analyze Lyft’s expansion strategy. On July 9th, a marketing manager emailed a subset of the company’s contractors in New York city with a new opportunity. "We have a special ongoing project that we’re going to be rolling out next week and I wanted to get about 8–10 of you to help out," he wrote. "This is going to be completely based on your own personal hustle, as it’s not a typical onsite event. We are going to have you working on your own time helping us sign up Uber drivers, and there is HUGE commission opportunity for everyone you signup."Operation SLOGThe special ongoing project had a different codename: SLOG. Contractors in New York who responded to the "special ongoing project" message were invited to individual hour-long meetings with Uber marketing managers, who had traveled from Los Angeles and Washington, DC, to New York to oversee the team’s creation.It was there that the company laid out its plan, according to a contractor. With Lyft’s arrival in New York imminent, Uber said it was creating a "street team" charged with gathering intelligence about Lyft’s launch plans and recruiting their drivers to Uber. Contractors were then handed two Uber-branded iPhones and a series of valid credit card numbers to be used for creating dummy Lyft accounts. Uber assumed every contractor would be caught by Lyft eventually the second phone, according to a contractor interviewed by The Verge, was issued so "you would have a backup phone if and when that happened so you wouldn’t have to go back."Backup phones for daysA follow-up email outlined the process for recruiting Lyft drivers in detail. It emphasizes the importance of requesting rides from different physical locations so as not to arouse Lyft’s suspicions, suggests methods of recruiting, and outlines the process for signing up drivers on Uber’s platform.  The message linked to an online form, which was still active as this story went to press, where Uber could collect information about the Lyft drivers.  As their plans evolved, Uber realized the likelihood that Lyft drivers would be recruited multiple times by its team members and alert Lyft about the street team’s existence. The solution: a private group on the messaging app GroupMe where members of the street team could post Lyft driver profiles. That way, Uber contractors could make sure their Lyft driver had not already been pitched. "You guys will run into drivers you have already got in cars with," a Los Angeles-based marketing manager emailed the team. "Post the driver profiles in groupme when you request so people are aware."In messages to the contractors, Uber’s marketing managers are full of good cheer. "Hello my lovely Sloggers!" begins one note, which gives instructions for filling out some paperwork. Once that’s out of the way, she writes, "then it’s all the little Lyfts your hearts desire." She ends her sentence with the hashtag #shavethestache, a reference to the big pink mustaches Lyft drivers affix to their vehicles’ grilles.  Uber appears to be replicating its program across the country. One email obtained by The Verge links to an online form for requesting burner phones, credit cards, and driver kits — everything an Uber driver needs to get started, which recruiters often carry with them. The form lists 10 cities, including LA, Seattle, Boston, Miami, and Washington, DC. "We are growing and growing so with that said this will put some organization to your madness," says the form, which was still live at the time of publication. "I need BA phones to make a lyft account," reads one line, referring to brand ambassadors "Great how many do you need," reads the line below."This will put some organization to your madness!"  Uber’s aggressive tactics reflect the fact that ridesharing is largely a zero-sum game: a driver picking up an Uber customer can’t simultaneously pick up a Lyft customer. (Drivers are allowed to drive for both services, though the companies discourage the practice.) Having more active drivers on the road creates a virtuous circle that improves geographical coverage, increases demand, and allows services to lower prices by taking a smaller cut from a growing number of rides. Uber and Lyft are competing to become the first app you think of when you need a taxi, and the service with the most drivers likely stands the best chance of winning.That helps to explain why competition between the two has become so vicious, with Uber and Lyft both offering hefty bonuses and other perks to drivers who switch services. For a time, Uber lost money on every ride to help spur demand. And Lyft has itself aggressively recruited Uber drivers, offering cash bonuses for joining, and hosting free taco lunches at its driver center. The Spy-vs.-Spy nature of their competition was revealed again earlier this month, when Uber caught wind of Lyft’s multi-passenger ridesharing offering and preemptively announced a nearly identical offering the night before Lyft made its announcement.Lyft declined to comment for this story. After Uber became aware that The Verge was asking questions, Target CW sent out multiple emails warning contractors that talking to the press violated a non-disclosure agreement they signed when they joined.
      Microsoft is planning to unveil its Windows 8 successor next month at a special press event. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the software maker is tentatively planning its press event for September 30th to detail upcoming changes to Windows as part of a release codenamed "Threshold." This date may change, but the Threshold version of Windows is currently in development and Microsoft plans to release a preview version of what will likely be named Windows 9 to developers on September 30th or shortly afterwards. The date follows recent reports from ZDNet that suggested Microsoft is planning to release a preview version of Windows 9 in late September or early October.A very early Windows 9 version for developersThe early technology preview will give developers a first look at the new mini Start Menu in Windows 9, alongside the removal of the Charms bar feature and several UI changes. Microsoft is currently compiling builds of Threshold ready for the preview that include an early version of Cortana, but it’s not clear if this particular feature will be made available as part of the technology preview.While Threshold is likely to be named Windows 9, it’s unlikely that Microsoft will name its upcoming Windows release at its press event. Instead, Microsoft is said to be planning an overview of key new features of the upcoming operating system, with a technical preview ready for developers and enthusiasts. Microsoft is also building a separate combined version of Windows RT and Windows Phone, and the company may take the time to detail this work during its press event. Either way, Microsoft’s next version of Windows is nearing completion and the company will be ready to talk more about it next month.Cortana for Windows Phone 8.1 hands-on
      Samsung will be showing its rumored virtual reality headset at its upcoming product event in early September, The Verge has learned, where the company is widely expected to announce the Galaxy Note 4. The headset — codenamed "Project Moonlight" — appears to be a bit like Google's Cardboard, a box with lenses that can effectively turn a smartphone display into an immersive world.Oculus may be involvedOculus — which uses a Note 3 display in some of its newer headsets — has previously been reported to be tied up with this project, a nod to the fact that modern smartphones have large, ultra-high-resolution displays and enough sensors to accomplish much of the orientation that a full virtual reality system needs. It's not known whether Oculus worked on the goggles pictured here, or whether the production version will look any different when it's shown on stage.Besides the lenses, Project Moonlight appears to have a focus dial and may have a Micro USB connection to the phone. The headset is pictured here next to a Galaxy S5, but given the positioning alongside the Note 4 launch, it's almost certain that the newest phone in Samsung's smartphone stable will be compatible. A lid appears to be used to hold the phone in place once it's connected.We should learn more at the September 3rd event three weeks from now, which will be held both in New York and at the IFA trade show in Berlin.  
      For years, Comcast has been giving its employees special cards to hand out to customers who had "a negative or unpleasant experience that is unresolved."Once called "Make It Right" cards and recently rebranded as "We're On It" cards, the cards are printed with a unique ID number and a "no wait" hotline that connects to a dedicated team of 250 customer service agents. Employees receive 12 cards a year, which they can hand out at their discretion.The cards are also printed with a QR code that directs customers to self-service options.Comcast handles more than a million customer interactions a day, according to the company, which means a lot of angry customers if even a tiny fraction of them go wrong. "Despite our best efforts, sometimes we don't get it exactly right," Tom Karinshak, senior vice president of customer experience, wrote in a note to employees. "The card directs customers to our dedicated team who can help resolve the issue — often in less than 24 hours.""We’re On It" gives employees the power to assist customers they meet outside of work  with a hotline to the "We’re On It" team and direct access to our online self-help tools.This  is a tool you can use to quickly and easily help when a customer approaches you outside  of work to resolve a repair or billing issue. The cards are designed to help you avoid  difficult and time consuming situations and provide you with a convenient and time saving  resource that assists both you and the customer.While the cards will unlock access to a dedicated team, those agents do not have any more power than regular customer service agents, Comcast says.The cards are just one of many venues where customers can get help, says D’Arcy Rudnay, Comcast's chief communications officer. "It's not an escalation, it's an option."Similarly, Comcast has a dedicated "digital care" team of 13 dedicated customer service agents who answer customers on Twitter, Facebook, and through the We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com email address. Comcast plans to add more agents to that team, she says.Meanwhile, the ecare@comcast.com email address and calls that go through the office of the president, which have been described on online forums as ways to jump the customer service queue, are routed to customer service agents normally."It's the same thing, just a different version," she says. "Every single one of these programs is our attempt to fix customers' problems, and we're serious about it."We're On ItOne customer service rep who worked for Comcast from 2005 to 2014 at a Tennessee call center says the "Make It Right" cards didn't necessarily lead to faster resolution, however. A search of the Comcast support forums shows this is true at least some of the time. "They're simply a palliative to pacify the public," she says. "It's the same level of customer service, only it has a colorful card which they can hold in their hands to make it seem special."Comcast, like most of the cable industry, has historically struggled with a reputation for lousy customer service. This year, the American Consumer Satisfaction Index ranked Comcast's internet service division second-to-last out of more than 230 companies across industries. Its television service didn't fare much better, and its phone service started to approach an average score. The only company that did worse than Comcast? Time Warner Cable, which Comcast is in talks to acquire.Rudnay says Comcast is honestly trying to improve, citing a forthcoming feature in the company's mobile app that will allow customers to take photos and video as they communicate with customer service agents. "Over and over again this year, the president of our company has said improving the customer experience is one of our number one priorities," she says.She also cited CEO Brian Roberts' response to a question from Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel at a conference in May: "We don't wake up every day, and go to work and say, 'We want to be hated.'"Disclosure: Comcast Ventures is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge's parent company.

      Microsoft is planning to launch two new Windows Phone 8.1 devices shortly. Sources familiar with the company’s plans tell The Verge that Microsoft devices chief Stephen Elop revealed both handsets during an internal company meeting this week. Elop showed off what he described as a “selfie phone” during the presentation, alongside video teasers of the two handsets. Microsoft’s selfie phone was previously revealed as codename Superman, a handset with a 5-megapixel forward-facing camera and 4.7-inch display. Pushing PureView down to the mid-rangeThe second handset is codenamed “Tesla,” and recently appeared in leaked images. Elop described the Tesla handset as an “affordable high-end phone” with a PureView camera. Tesla will likely debut as a Lumia 720 replacement, and it mark a new effort by Microsoft to push PureView down to even lower price points. The handset looks similar to the squared Lumia 930, but we understand it will be thinner and less bulky.Elop’s revelation at Microsoft’s annual company meeting event indicates that the device launches are imminent. It also comes just days after Microsoft’s Jo Harlow revealed, in an internal memo, that the company is planning to launch “other high-end products…very soon.” Microsoft is expected to provide Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 to developers and device makers shortly, an update that includes hardware and feature improvements ready for new devices. Alongside Microsoft’s own devices, HTC is also reportedly planning to launch a Windows Phone version of its One M8 in August on Verizon.
      Nokia might have been famous for its feature phones, but Microsoft is planning to wind that business down over the course of the next 18 months. In an internal memo sent to Microsoft employees, Jo Harlow, who heads up the phone business under Microsoft devices, reveals the focus is very much on Windows Phone. Development and investment for Asha, Series 40, and Nokia X handsets will shift to what is described as "maintenance mode," and services to support existing devices will be shut down over the next 18 months. "This means there will be no new features or updates to services on any mobile phones platform as a result of these plans," says Harlow, in the internal memo seen by The Verge.Microsoft will instead try to tempt its installed base of feature and Symbian users over to Windows Phone. "Whereas successful hardware was the goal at Nokia delighting our customers with Microsoft platforms, services, and applications through our hardware is our goal at Microsoft," says Harlow. Alongside the feature-phone cuts, Microsoft is also planning to offer Nokia MixRadio as a third-party service. The software maker is considering options to spin off the service, and has initiated discussions with "strong interest" from third parties. Until MixRadio is sold, it has also been moved into maintenance mode. New high-end Lumias are coming 'very soon'Focusing on Windows Phone means the majority of upcoming low- and high-end devices from Microsoft will run the company’s own software and services. Microsoft’s devices group is planning to "shift our flagship engineering efforts towards new flagship products timed with the next release of Windows and Windows Phone," meaning we’ll likely see even more high-end Windows Phones for the release of codename "Threshold" next year. "To drive success in the short term, we plan to focus our high end go-to-market strategy on the Lumia 930, Lumia 1520, and other high-end products that we will be announcing very soon," says Harlow.The changes align with Microsoft’s plans to kill off Nokia’s Android phones, and transition these to Windows Phone in the future. Harlow says "speed here will matter" in switching Nokia X designs and products over to Lumia and Windows Phone, and that these handsets will represent Microsoft’s focus on the affordable smartphone market over the course of the next year.
      Microsoft is trying to cram Kinect-like features into its future flagship Windows Phone handsets. At least one device, codenamed McLaren, will debut on a range of US carriers later this year with features that let you hover your finger over the screen to interact with games and applications without ever touching the display. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge that the technology, known internally as 3D Touch or Real Motion, has been developed by Nokia over a number of years. Evleaks first unveiled the existence of Nokia McLaren, and we understand the device will largely be seen as a Lumia 1020 successor with a similar hump in the rear casing for a powerful camera.The unique aspect of McLaren will be the number of sensors on the device to make way for the 3D Touch system. While Microsoft is reaching out to top developers to support the new system with apps and games, 3D Touch will be unique to its own devices and will not be available initially on handsets from Samsung, HTC, among others. Features like answering calls by holding the phone to your ear will be supported, along with the ability to set the phone down on a table to enable speakerphone, or to hang up a call by placing it in your pocket. Phones that support 3D Touch will use a number of hardware sensors to allow devices to mute when they are covered by a hand or held to a chest, or to dismiss alerts by waving a hand in front of the screen.Eliminating buttons is a key aspectMicrosoft is also planning to detect how a phone is held by grip, allowing a 3D Touch-enabled phone to block an orientation switch when you’re lying down in bed. The sides of the phone will also be used to interact with the operating system, and a camera feature will let you zoom simply by dragging your fingers along the side of the device. Central to Microsoft’s thinking are ways to simplify devices and remove buttons like the power button so phone owners can simply grip their device to power it on.While Microsoft had originally planned to debut its 3D Touch features with Windows Phone 8.1 and a Nokia "Goldfinger" handset, we understand that the work has been pushed to an additional update planned for later this year. Goldfinger still exists, but it’s simply being used as an engineering device to prepare developers for the upcoming changes and the McLaren launch.MixView brings a new Tile layout to Windows PhoneAnother key part to the 3D Touch experience is several UX changes to Windows Phone. A new MixView, originally detailed by WP Central, allows 3D Touch users to hover over a Live Tile and tap down in the air, without touching the display, to reveal a number of smaller Tiles that are relevant to that particular app. On a Facebook Tile you may see a messaging Tile and phone Tile appear that will allow Windows Phone users to quickly call pinned contacts. The Tiles displayed on screen look like they have simply exploded from the original tile, and the concept comes from the Zune MixView feature that placed a music artist at the center of the screen surrounded by related content.As Amazon is reportedly preparing similar 3D features for its upcoming smartphone, the real question for Microsoft will be whether its own system is unique enough to act as a differentiator in the high-end smartphone market. Samsung has its own Air Gestures to change music tracks, accept phone calls, and scroll through webpages, but they’re often gimmicky and underused. If Microsoft’s 3D Touch system is easy to use then it could be as natural as the screen double tapping to power on a handset that currently exists on most Nokia Windows Phones today. If it’s not, then it’s a big gamble on bringing Kinect-like interactions to the device that lives in your pocket.
  When NBC Nightly News aired a segment last week about the revival of the public television show Reading Rainbow, the anchor didn’t pause to explain where the money came from. “Longtime host LeVar Burton launched a Kickstarter campaign to bring it back,” correspondent Janet Shamlian gushed, as the camera showed numbers ticking up on the project’s funding page. “His goal was $1 million in 35 days. He had it in 11 hours.”In the past, Shamlian would have explained that Kickstarter was a...  Continue reading&amphellip
  Pocket, which lets you save articles and videos to view later, is introducing a paid option. Pocket Premium, which offers power users new features for archiving, searching, and tagging their saves, launches today for $5 a month or $44.99 a year. Seven years after the company began as a bookmarklet, and two years after making its apps free to build its base of customers, the save-for-later service says it's now big enough for a "freemium" business model to make sense. At a time when webpages...  Continue reading&amphellip
      Springpad, a productivity app that struggled to stand out from similar offerings from Evernote and Pinterest, is planning to close its doors, The Verge has learned. The six-year-old Boston company, which raised more than $7 million, had around 400,000 people using its digital notebooks to save tasks, notes, checklists, and more. But it never came close to matching the momentum of Evernote, which said this month that it now has over 100 million users.It's unclear when the service will end or how Springpad plans to tell its users, but the move appears imminent, according to a person familiar with the company's plans. Last year, Springpad incorporated features into its app to make it feel more like Pinterest, letting users search public posts and follow other users' notebooks. But the company never developed a unique identity in a landscape crowded with better-funded and slicker alternatives. The company hasn't tweeted since May 1st, though it seems to still be fielding requests on its support account on Twitter.The team behind Springpad plans to build a new product, a source said, but it's unclear what it will be.Springpad declined to comment on this story.Update: Springpad has confirmed its closing in a blog post. The service will shut down on June 25th. "At that point Springpad.com will no longer be available, all online and sync features of the mobile apps will stop working, and your personal data will no longer be stored on our servers," the company said. It will make available an export tool to help users with the transition to another service.
  Tumblr founder David Karp thinks a lot about the web as it was 15 years ago. A web filled with blinking words, Shockwave Flash, and GeoCities pages packed to the brim with clip art. It was a weird, unstructured, seemingly limitless domain where, armed with a few HTML tips from a friend or message board, you could build your first home page and publish it to the world.But then everything changed.“In the early 2000s, [the web] started to take a pretty sharp turn towards vanilla, white...

      To help build and power its new cross-platform video chat service, Snapchat acquired software company AddLive, sources tell The Verge. Snapchat confirmed the deal to The Verge, saying "We are excited to welcome the AddLive team to the Snapchat family. We have no further comment at this time."The deal went through several months ago, sources say, after Snapchat went on the hunt for companies with the expertise to handle the video platform it envisioned. Snapchat's new video chat lets you initiate video chats within seconds across a great variety of smartphone hardware, which is no small feat. AddLive had previous experience in the space, providing business-to-business voice and audio services for Citrix and a variety of other companies."AddLive allows companies to quickly deploy real-time communications with minimal development time," the company's website states. Some of the other features AddLive offers are screen-sharing, multi-party conferencing, and support for browser-based video chat via WebRTC. The company is considered a leader in the browser-based video space, having won the "Best WebRTC Tool" in 2013 awarded by the WebRTC Conference &amp Expo.While we don't know the exact details of the deal, with over $120 million raised and a relatively small team of 70, Snapchat had some money to burn.
      One of the first Windows Phone 8.1 devices due for release after Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia’s phone business will be focused on the front-facing camera capabilities. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that a Nokia ‘Superman’ device is currently in development with a 5-megapixel camera at the front. Nokia has typically reserved such additions for the rear of its devices, but Superman marks a shift. It’s not clear if Microsoft plans to market Superman as the ultimate selfie-taking phone, but a 5-megapixel camera at the front instead of the standard 1-megapixel offering is no accident. Superman will join HTC's recently released One M8, which also includes a 5-megapixel front-facing camera.We understand that Superman is designed as a 4.7-inch mid-range handset that’s expected to debut towards the end of the year. Microsoft is also currently working towards two Windows Phone 8.1 updates that will be delivered over the course of 2014. Like previous Windows Phone 8 updates, the pair of 8.1 updates will coincide with new handsets and will be rolled out to existing devices. The first update is tentatively scheduled for July, and Superman is expected to debut alongside the second later this year. A trio of Windows Phone 8.1 handsetsMicrosoft is working on additional Windows Phone 8.1 handsets that will be released this year. A "Goldfinger" device was scheduled to debut alongside Windows Phone 8.1, but crucial support for new off-the-glass gestures was delayed to an update for Windows Phone 8.1. Goldfinger is still undergoing testing, and Microsoft is also readying another two Windows Phone 8.1 handsets alongside it. It’s still not clear whether any of these devices will include Nokia branding on them. Microsoft appears to be taking the transition slowly, and the company has not yet detailed its plans for future branding.Correction: this article reference an upcoming update to Windows Phone 8.1 scheduled for June. The update is tentatively scheduled for July, not June. We have updated the article, and regret the error.
  “Okay, can I take it out of the box now?”Lytro product director Colvin Pitts wants to show me the camera he’s been working on since 2007. He cautions that it’s just an early model, then gently lifts the stark, black device out of an unmarked box. It looks like a cross between a DSLR and a futuristic weapon. It’s big, with a wide round lens and a large grip, but it weighs less than 2 pounds and is perfectly comfortable in my hands. Its back face is slanted, like someone chopped off...

      A third of the way into 2014, we already have new flagship phones from almost all the big Android handset makers: the Galaxy S5, the Xperia Z2, and the new One are all now on sale. The one company that's kept relatively quiet throughout the period has been LG, manufacturer of the much-loved G2 and Google's Nexus 5. Today some of the mystery about its future plans has been dispelled as The Verge has received the first image of the retail box for LG's next big Android phone. Originally codenamed the B2, the new phone takes the predictable title of LG G3 and is set for a summer release.LG has never seen a spec it didn't want to enlargeThe gold-colored box is not incidental. Sources tell The Verge that the Korean phone maker intends to launch its next flagship in a golden hue, matching the broader trend that's been embraced by the gold Galaxy S5, HTC One, iPhone 5S, and LG's own golden G2 variant. When reached for comment, LG declined to discuss its future product plans, though it did confirm an earlier report from UberGizmo that its next phone will feature a 2560 x 1440 screen resolution.Extreme high-resolution displays of this kind were rumored for Samsung's S5 and anticipated to arrive earlier in the year. Indeed they have made their way into the market through devices like the 5.5-inch Oppo 7, but LG's G3 is likely to be the first 1440p phone from the major manufacturers. The advantage of adding yet more pixels into phone displays can be described as dubious at this point, as it increases power consumption without necessarily improving on the image quality of a 1080p screen. That's likely why Samsung demurred on using the resolution, but LG has another trick up its sleeve when it comes to displays.A recently leaked image of an LG isai FL — a new LG handset ostensibly headed for Japanese carrier KDDI — depicts a device with an especially thin bezel around the display. Labelled as the LGL24, this looks set to be the successor to the LGL22, which was a variant of the G2 modified for the Japanese market. Our sources confirm that the new phone in Japan will bear a familial resemblance to the new G3, suggesting that it too will benefit from the aggressively styled front. The date on the LGL24's screen is May 1st, which could also give a hint to its intended announcement timing.There's no indication yet that the G3 will serve as the platform on which Google will build its next Nexus device. That was the relationship between the G2 and the Nexus 5, but given that the latter device is still only a few months old, it's probably a little too early to be discussing a potential Nexus 6, anyway.
  It’s a sunny morning in Camarillo, California, and the fields along Pleasant Valley road are full of berry pickers in colored sweatshirts moving swiftly to gather ripe fruit.

      Google is about to make its biggest push yet to get Glass in the hands of as many people as possible. The Verge has obtained documents indicating that the company will open up its "Explorer Program" and make Glass available to anyone who wants to purchase a pair, possibly as soon as next week. It’ll be a limited-time offer, only available for about a day, and only US residents will be eligible to purchase the $1,500 device. Google will also include a free sunglass shade or one of its newly-introduced prescription glasses frames along with any purchase. An internal Google slide shows that the promotion may be announced on April 15th, though all the details of this program have yet to be finalized.While this program will make Glass available to anyone in the US who wants to buy it, Google makes it clear on the leaked slide that this is an expansion of its existing Explorer program, not a full consumer release (still expected for later in  2014). It sounds like Google simply wants to get the device in the hands of as many people as possible for testing and development purposes ahead of that launch. Alternately, it could be Google's way of clearing out Explorer edition stock ahead of the full consumer launch.A big push for Glass ahead of its eventual consumer releasePrevious implementations of the Glass Explorer program have come with limitations of their own — Google first started accepting pre-orders for the device nearly two years ago at Google I/O 2012. That brought in about 2,000 orders, and another 8,000 people got their hands on a pair through a wider promotion later that year in which consumers told Google what they would do if they had their own Glass headset. Since then, Google has made Glass available through some smaller campaigns as well as opening up friend referrals and an ongoing waitlist to become an Explorer — but this new program could symbolize Google’s last major effort to ramp up the developer community ahead of the official Glass launch.Update April 10 4:05PM: Google has officially announced its plan to sell Glass for one day only. In a Google+ post, the Glass team confirms that anyone in the US can purchase Glass on Tuesday, April 15th starting at 9AM ET. Google says orders will include the free sunglass shade or prescription lens frame, and notes that supplies will be limited. You can purchase at this link next Tuesday..video-wrap {margin-top: 0px !important}Watch now: 90 Seconds on The Verge
  “Who in their right mind would build an email client?” Gentry Underwood asked himself nearly two years ago. At the time, it was a fact of life that email sucked. Nobody cared about rethinking email. So he built an email client. At launch, Mailbox generated so much hype that nearly 1 million people joined a wait list to get access to it. The app promised a simple, lightning-fast experience that made emailing feel like texting. And it introduced “snooze,” a feature that let you put off...  Continue reading&amphellip
